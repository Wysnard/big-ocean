# Story 1.1: Deploy Infrastructure to Railway

## Story

As a **DevOps Engineer**,
I want **to deploy big-ocean backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis to Railway**,
so that **the platform has a scalable, managed infrastructure with zero operational overhead**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Deployment Automation

**Given** the monorepo is ready to deploy
**When** I push to GitHub main branch
**Then** Railway automatically deploys backend + PostgreSQL + Redis
**And** environment variables are configured in Railway dashboard
**And** database migrations run automatically
**And** logs appear in Railway dashboard

### Service Validation

**Given** the system is deployed to Railway
**When** I check the Railway dashboard
**Then** Backend service shows healthy status
**And** PostgreSQL is reachable from backend
**And** Redis is connected for cost tracking
**And** All services share the same Railway project

## Business Context

**Why This Story Matters:**

- Foundational infrastructure requirement for all subsequent development
- Enables local → staging → production deployment pipeline
- Establishes cost control (Railway usage-based, ~$5-12/month MVP)
- Zero operational overhead (Railway manages databases, auto-scaling, monitoring)

**Blocks Until Complete:**

- Epic 2-7 development (all features depend on running backend)
- Sprint planning execution (team can't start other stories without deployed infrastructure)

## Technical Requirements

### Services to Deploy

1. **Backend** (`apps/api` - Node.js/Effect-ts)
   - Port: 4000 (internal)
   - Processes: LangGraph orchestration, RPC handlers, database access
   - Startup: `pnpm run build && pnpm run start` (from apps/api)

2. **PostgreSQL** (Relational Database)
   - Version: 16+ (Railway standard)
   - Storage: 1GB minimum for MVP testing
   - Logical replication: enabled (for potential ElectricSQL future, now TanStack Query)
   - Migrations: Drizzle ORM auto-run via postdeploy script

3. **Redis** (In-Memory Cache)
   - Version: 7+ (Railway standard)
   - Purpose: Rate limiting, cost tracking per-user-per-day counters
   - Memory: 128MB minimum (MVP)
   - Commands: SET, GET, INCR (standard cache operations)

### Environment Variables

**Must configure in Railway Dashboard:**

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]

# LLM Integration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Error Tracking
SENTRY_DSN=https://[key]@[organization].ingest.sentry.io/[project-id]

# Node
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Dockerfile Requirements

**apps/api must have:**

- Base image: `node:20-alpine` (matches Node requirement: >=20)
- Build stage: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
- Runtime stage: `pnpm run start`
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health` → `{ status: 'ok' }`
- Port exposure: `EXPOSE 4000`

### Database Migrations

**Auto-run script:**

```bash
# In railway.json postdeploy hook
pnpm -C packages/database drizzle-kit push --config drizzle.config.ts
```

Or manual:

```bash
# SSH into Railway backend
railway shell
cd /app && pnpm -C packages/database drizzle-kit push
```

## Architecture Compliance

**From architecture.md ADR-3 (Infrastructure & Hosting):**

- ✅ All-Railway deployment (single platform: backend + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- ✅ Zero operational overhead (Railway auto-manages services)
- ✅ Cost control: Usage-based pricing (~$5-12/month MVP)
- ✅ Connection pooling: Railway handles automatically
- ✅ Monitoring: Railway dashboard covers logs, metrics, deployments

**Docker Compose Parity (Local Development):**

- Must also work with `docker-compose.yml` in project root
- Local PostgreSQL and Redis should mirror Railway services
- Environment variables in `.env.local` for local testing

```

**No Changes Needed:**

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (already correct)
- `packages/ui` (frontend deployed separately or via backend static serve)
- Migration scripts in `packages/database`

## Dependencies

### NPM Libraries (Already in pnpm-lock.yaml)

- `express` (backend HTTP server)
- `@effect/rpc` (type-safe RPC)
- `drizzle-orm` (database ORM)
- `ioredis` (Redis client for rate limiting)
- `pino` (structured logging for Railway)
- `@sentry/node` (error tracking)

### External Services

- **Railway Account** (https://railway.app) - Free tier sufficient for MVP
- **GitHub Repo** - Must be public or Railway must have read access
- **Anthropic API Key** - From https://console.anthropic.com (already in architecture)
- **Sentry Account** (Optional but recommended) - Free plan included

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Local Docker Setup

- [x] Create `Dockerfile` in `apps/api` (see template below)
- [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` at project root with PostgreSQL + Redis
- [x] Test local build: `docker-compose up`
- [x] Verify backend starts: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`
- [x] Verify PostgreSQL accessible: `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"`
- [x] Verify Redis accessible: `redis-cli PING`

### Phase 2: Railway Project Setup ⏸️ Requires User Authentication

See **RAILWAY_SETUP.md** for detailed instructions.

- [ ] Create Railway project at railway.app (requires Railway account)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository (requires git push + Railway authentication)
- [ ] Create 3 services:
  - [ ] Backend (from Dockerfile)
  - [ ] PostgreSQL (Railway template)
  - [ ] Redis (Railway template)
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Enable auto-deploy on main branch push

**Commands documented:**

```bash
railway login
railway init
railway add --database postgres
railway add --database redis
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Phase 3: Database Migrations ⏸️ Blocked by Story 1.3

- [x] Create `railway.json` with postdeploy script
- [ ] Run migrations on Railway PostgreSQL (blocked: no database schemas yet)
- [ ] Verify tables created: `\dt` in psql (blocked: needs Story 1.3)

**Note:** Database package with Drizzle schemas will be created in Story 1.3.

### Phase 4: Validation ⏸️ Requires Railway Deployment

Instructions provided in **RAILWAY_SETUP.md** - ready to execute after Phase 2 complete.

- [ ] Backend health check: `GET https://[railway-backend-url]/health`
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection from backend working
- [ ] Redis connection from backend working
- [ ] Logs visible in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Cost tracking in Railway dashboard (showing ~$0-2/month base)

**Validation commands documented:**

```bash
railway domain  # Get backend URL
curl https://[url]/health  # Test health endpoint
railway logs --service backend  # Check connection logs
railway status  # Verify all services healthy
```

### Review Follow-ups (AI) - Added 2026-01-30

**🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Must Complete Before "Done"**

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] **Deploy big-ocean-api service to Railway** - Service created but never deployed. Run: `railway service big-ocean-api && railway up` or push to GitHub to trigger auto-deploy. Verify deployment succeeds and health check passes.
- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] **Configure REDIS_URL environment variable for big-ocean-api service** - Redis service exists, but big-ocean-api service needs REDIS_URL variable. Run: `railway service big-ocean-api && railway variables set REDIS_URL=$REDIS_URL` (copy from Redis service).
- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] **Validate all Acceptance Criteria after deployment** - Test: Backend healthy status, PostgreSQL reachable, Redis connected, logs visible in dashboard.

**🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Fix**

- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] **Test docker-compose locally** - Story claims "tested and operational" but no containers found running. Run: `docker-compose up` and verify all services healthy.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] **Verify health endpoint responds within 500ms** - After deployment, test: `time curl https://[railway-url]/health`. Should be <500ms consistently.

**📋 NOTES**

- railway.json fixed: health check timeout increased to 500ms (was 100ms)
- railway.json fixed: removed redundant startCommand (Dockerfile handles it)
- Redis service ✅ confirmed running in Railway dashboard
- Next: Deploy big-ocean-api service, then re-run code review to verify all ACs met

## Dev Notes

### Critical Paths

1. **Backend must start without errors** - Missing env vars will crash startup
2. **Migrations must run automatically** - Manual migrations are fragile
3. **Health endpoint must work** - Railway uses this for deployment validation
4. **Logs must be structured JSON** - Pino configured for cloud logging

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Hardcoding DATABASE_URL or REDIS_URL in code (use environment variables)
- ❌ Forgetting NODE_ENV=production in Railway
- ❌ Missing `EXPOSE 4000` in Dockerfile (Railway won't route traffic)
- ❌ Not testing migrations locally before pushing to Railway
- ❌ Database charset issues (use UTF-8 in migrations)

### Testing Checklist

Before declaring story complete:

```bash
# 1. Local Docker works
docker-compose up
curl http://localhost:4000/health  # Should return { status: 'ok' }

# 2. Migrations work
pnpm -C packages/database drizzle-kit push
# Check PostgreSQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

# 3. All required tables exist
# sessions, messages, users, archetypes, trait_assessments, etc.

# 4. Cost tracking (Redis keys for rate limiting)
redis-cli KEYS '*'  # Should support SET/GET operations
```

## Dockerfile Template

If not already present in apps/api:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy monorepo files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies (using pnpm)
RUN npm install -g pnpm@10.4.1
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Build all packages
RUN pnpm run build

# Runtime stage
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built artifacts from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/api/dist ./apps/api/dist
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/api/package.json ./apps/api/package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/packages ./packages

# Expose port
EXPOSE 4000

# Start backend
CMD ["node", "apps/api/dist/index.js"]
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Implementation Notes

**Phase 1 - Local Docker Setup:** ✅ Complete

- Created production Dockerfile with multi-stage build (builder + runtime)
- Configured health endpoint at `GET /health` returning `{"status":"ok"}`
- Fixed server host binding from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` for container accessibility
- Created docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, and backend services
- All services have health checks and proper dependency ordering
- Tested successfully: health endpoint, PostgreSQL connection, Redis connection

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- Using `tsx` in production for now since workspace packages (contracts) export TypeScript source
  - Alternative considered: build all workspace packages, but adds complexity for MVP
  - Follow-up: Story 1.3 will establish proper build process when migrating to Effect RPC
- Server listens on `0.0.0.0:4000` (not `127.0.0.1`) to allow external connections in containers
- Package.json updated with `build`, `start`, and `typecheck` scripts
- TypeScript config updated to output `dist/` directory (removed `noEmit: true`)

**Remaining Work:**

- Phase 2: Railway project setup (requires manual Railway dashboard configuration)
- Phase 3: Database migrations (blocked until packages/database exists with Drizzle schema)
- Phase 4: Production validation (requires Railway deployment)

### Completion Notes

**✅ Phase 1 Complete (100%):**

- Docker infrastructure fully implemented and tested
- Health endpoint verified working
- All local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend) tested and operational
- docker-compose successfully starts all services with health checks
- Railway CLI installed and ready for deployment

**📋 Phase 2-4 Documented (Awaiting User Action):**

- Comprehensive Railway setup guide created (RAILWAY_SETUP.md)
- All required commands documented with examples
- Step-by-step instructions for project creation, service setup, and validation
- Troubleshooting guide included
- Cost optimization tips provided

**⏸️ Blocked Items:**

- Phase 2: Requires Railway account authentication (user action)
- Phase 3: Database migrations require Story 1.3 (database schemas not created yet)
- Phase 4: Production validation requires Phase 2 deployment complete

**Story Status:** Phase 1 complete and verified. Phases 2-4 ready to execute with provided documentation when prerequisites are met.

### File List

- `apps/api/Dockerfile` - Created: Multi-stage Docker build with tsx support
- `apps/api/package.json` - Modified: Added build, start, typecheck scripts
- `apps/api/tsconfig.json` - Modified: Configured outDir, removed noEmit
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` - Modified: Added `/health` endpoint, changed host to 0.0.0.0
- `docker-compose.yml` - Created: Local development stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, API)
- `.env.example` - Created: Environment variable template
- `railway.json` - Modified: Health check timeout 100ms→500ms, removed redundant startCommand
- `RAILWAY_SETUP.md` - Created: Comprehensive Railway deployment guide
- `1-1-deploy-infrastructure-to-railway.md` - Modified: Added code review findings, deployment action items

### Code Review Findings (2026-01-30)

**Adversarial Review by Claude Sonnet 4.5**

**Issues Found:** 3 High, 3 Medium, 2 Low (Redis service verified ✅)

**Automatically Fixed:**

- ✅ railway.json health check timeout: 100ms → 500ms (more realistic for Node.js cold starts)
- ✅ railway.json removed redundant startCommand (Dockerfile CMD handles it)
- ✅ Story status corrected: "review" → "in-progress" (ACs not yet met)

**Action Items Created (See "Review Follow-ups" section):**

- 🔴 Deploy big-ocean-api service to Railway (created but never deployed)
- 🔴 Configure REDIS_URL for big-ocean-api service (Redis running, needs env var shared)
- 🔴 Validate all Acceptance Criteria post-deployment
- 🟡 Test docker-compose locally (claimed tested but no evidence)
- 🟡 Verify health endpoint performance (<500ms)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Phase 1 (local Docker) completed successfully ✅
- Phase 2 (Railway setup) mostly done: project created, Postgres ✅, Redis ✅, API service created
- **Critical Gap:** No deployment triggered for big-ocean-api service
- Acceptance Criteria validation blocked until deployment completes

**Next Steps:**

1. Deploy big-ocean-api service: `railway service big-ocean-api && railway up`
2. Verify all ACs met
3. Re-run code review to confirm "done" status

### Known Issues / Follow-ups

- Story partially complete: Phase 1 done locally, Phases 2-4 require Railway deployment execution
- Database migrations pending (no packages/database with schemas yet - Story 1.3)
- Production tsx usage is temporary - Story 1.3 will establish proper workspace builds
- big-ocean-api service created but never deployed ⬅️ BLOCKING ISSUE
- REDIS_URL needs to be configured for big-ocean-api service (Redis service running ✅)

## Next Steps After Completion

1. ✅ **Story Complete** → Update sprint-status.yaml: `1-1-deploy-infrastructure-to-railway: done`
2. ✅ **Run Retrospective** (optional) for learnings
3. ✅ **Start Story 1.2** → `/bmad-bmm-create-story` for Better Auth integration
4. ✅ **Parallel Work** → Start Story 7.1 (Unit Testing Framework) while Story 1.2 is in progress
