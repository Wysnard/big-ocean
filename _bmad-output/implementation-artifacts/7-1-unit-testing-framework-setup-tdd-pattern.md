# Story 7.1: Unit Testing Framework Setup & TDD Pattern

**Story ID:** 7.1
**Story Key:** 7-1-unit-testing-framework-setup-tdd-pattern
**Epic:** 7 - Testing & Quality Assurance
**Status:** review
**Created:** 2026-01-30

## Story

As a **Developer**,
I want **to set up Vitest with Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow for backend features**,
So that **all domain logic, RPC contracts, and backend services are built with comprehensive test coverage**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria

**Given** Vitest is configured across the monorepo
**When** I run `pnpm test`
**Then** all unit tests execute in <2 seconds total
**And** I can run `pnpm test --ui` for interactive test browser
**And** coverage reports generated showing domain logic at 100%

**Given** I'm implementing a domain feature (e.g., OCEAN code generation)
**When** I follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle
**Then** I write failing test first (red phase)
**And** test defines expected behavior with assertion
**And** I implement code to pass test (green phase)
**And** I refactor for clarity while keeping tests green

**Given** a backend feature story requires testing
**When** the story is implemented
**Then** unit tests exist for all code paths
**And** coverage report shows ≥100% for domain logic, ≥90% for RPC contracts

## Developer Context

### Project Overview

**big-ocean** is a psychological profiling platform using the Big Five personality framework. This story establishes the testing foundation that enables all subsequent backend development (Stories 2.1-2.5, 3.1-3.2, 6.1-6.3).

**Key Context for Developer:**
- **Monorepo Structure:** Apps (frontend: `apps/front`, backend: `apps/api`) + Packages (`domain`, `contracts`, `database`, `infrastructure`, `ui`)
- **Tech Stack Locked:** Effect-ts 3.19.14, @effect/rpc 0.73.0, @effect/schema 0.71.0, Drizzle ORM 0.45.1, PostgreSQL
- **Critical Path:** Testing framework must be ready BEFORE Epic 2 implementation (backend services depend on this)
- **Team Model:** Primarily solo dev (Vincentlay) with potential future AI agent collaboration

### Business Context

**Highest Risk for MVP Success:** LLM costs exploding before product-market fit. This story establishes the testing discipline that prevents expensive regressions in cost control logic (Story 2.5) and the multi-agent orchestration (Story 2.4).

**MVP Target:** 500 beta users with unit test coverage preventing:
- Cost calculation bugs (would be catastrophic at scale)
- Session management issues (users lose assessment data)
- OCEAN code generation determinism failures (same traits must always produce same code)

---

## Technical Requirements

### Vitest Framework Setup

**Must implement:**

1. **Vitest Configuration for Monorepo**
   - ESM-native configuration (required for modern Node.js + pnpm workspaces)
   - Test discovery: `*.test.ts` pattern in core packages
   - Test execution: `pnpm test` runs all tests, `pnpm test --ui` opens interactive browser
   - Performance target: All tests complete in <2 seconds (critical for developer feedback loop)

2. **Package-Level Test Setup**
   - `packages/domain` - Domain logic tests (100% coverage target)
   - `packages/contracts` - RPC contract tests (90%+ coverage target)
   - `packages/database` - Database interaction tests (70%+ coverage target)
   - `packages/infrastructure` - Dependency injection tests (80%+ coverage target)
   - `apps/api` - Backend handler tests (80%+ coverage target for story implementations)

3. **Vitest Plugins & Extensions**
   - `@vitest/ui` for interactive test browser (developer productivity)
   - `@vitest/coverage-v8` for code coverage reporting
   - `vi.mock()` utilities for mocking external dependencies
   - Snapshot testing for OCEAN archetype descriptions (Story 3.2)

### Test Utilities & Mocks

**Must provide:**

1. **Mock Utilities**
   - Mock Anthropic API responses (deterministic for Nerin testing)
   - Mock PostgreSQL database (for unit tests without TestContainers)
   - Mock Cost Guard for cost tracking testing
   - Mock Rate Limiter for limiting rules testing

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Sample conversation data (reusable across tests)
   - Sample facet scores (for Scorer testing in Story 2.3)
   - Sample OCEAN codes (for archetype lookup testing in Story 3.2)

3. **Helper Functions**
   - `createTestSession()` - Generate test session with predictable data
   - `mockNerin()` - Mock Nerin agent response with token counts
   - `mockAnalyzer()` - Mock pattern extraction result
   - `mockScorer()` - Mock facet score output

### TDD Workflow

**Process to implement:**

1. **Red Phase:** Write test first that fails
   - Test file: `module.test.ts`
   - Describe expected behavior with clear assertions
   - Test fails because implementation doesn't exist (expected state)

2. **Green Phase:** Implement code to pass test
   - Keep implementation minimal (no over-engineering)
   - Test passes, confirming behavior is correct

3. **Refactor Phase:** Improve code while keeping tests green
   - Extract reusable functions
   - Simplify logic for clarity
   - All tests still pass (regression prevention)

### Coverage Targets

| Package/Module | Coverage Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/domain` | **100%** | Core business logic, zero tolerance for bugs |
| RPC Contracts | **90%+** | API contracts between frontend/backend |
| Cost calculation (Story 2.5) | **100%** | Financial calculations, critical |
| OCEAN code generation (Story 3.1) | **100%** | Determinism critical |
| Scorer/Analyzer logic (Story 2.3) | **95%+** | Statistical calculations, must be precise |
| Session management (Story 2.1) | **95%+** | User data persistence, high risk |
| Encryption/Decryption (Story 6.1) | **100%** | Security-critical |
| GDPR operations (Story 6.2) | **100%** | Legal compliance |

### Effect-ts Integration

**Tests must be Effect-native:**
- Use `Effect.runSync()` or `Effect.runPromise()` in tests
- Leverage Effect's error handling for predictable test outcomes
- Mock Effect Services for isolated unit testing
