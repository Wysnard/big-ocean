# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# DESIGN THINKING 2026-02-20: Pending Story Creation
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The following work items were identified in design-thinking-2026-02-20.md
# and need to be converted into formal stories via the create-story workflow.
# Prototypes A-M complete. Implementation ordered by testing priority.
#
# PRIORITY 1 — Chat Foundation (Prototypes F, L, M, G):
#   Scope: Trimmed NERIN_PERSONA (~780→~350 tokens), revised CHAT_CONTEXT
#     with beliefs/threading/depth/mirrors, mirror library injection (13 mirrors),
#     edge case handling, emoji palette, anti-patterns
#   Files: nerin-persona.ts, nerin-system-prompt.ts + tests
#   Suggested: Epic 2, Story 2.13
#   Test: A/B prompt comparison (3 scenarios, score ≥10/14), edge cases, limits
#
# PRIORITY 2 — Portrait (Prototypes D, J):
#   Scope: Revised PORTRAIT_CONTEXT (letter framing, confidant voice, 4-section
#     architecture, depth adaptation), move scaffold computation (5 move types),
#     MoveScaffold interface, depth/tone signals, finalization integration
#   Files: portrait-generator.claude.repository.ts, get-results.use-case.ts, domain types
#   Suggested: Epic 8, Story 8.7
#   Test: A/B portrait comparison (3 runs, score ≥16/23)
#
# PRIORITY 3 — Greeting (Prototype K):
#   Scope: Combine greeting 1+2 (3→2 messages), replace beach question,
#     add "boring true thing" question, investigate cadence impact, update seeds
#   Files: nerin-greeting.ts + tests, seed scripts
#   Suggested: Epic 2, Story 2.14
#   Test: Greeting preference test (3-5 people)
#
# PRIORITY 4 — Transition UX (Prototype I):
#   Scope: Nerin farewell generation (agent final turn), auth gate redesign
#     on chat page (hybrid approach), wait screen with rotating Nerin lines
#     (10s minimum), portrait-first reveal layout
#   Files: frontend components, routes, use-cases
#   Suggested: Epic 7, Story 7.18
#   Test: Full self-test session (score ≥4/5)
#
# PRIORITY 5 — Full Validation:
#   Scope: End-to-end testing with trusted testers (2-3 sessions),
#     feedback collection, key learnings documentation
#   Not a formal story — manual testing phase after Priority 1-4
