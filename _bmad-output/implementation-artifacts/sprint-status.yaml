# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Epic 1** (Infrastructure & Auth): Deploy to Railway, set up Better Auth, configure RPC contracts
- **Parallel:** Story 7.1 (Unit Test Framework) to establish TDD patterns for subsequent features

## Phase 2: Backend Logic (Weeks 3-5)
- **Epic 2** (Assessment Backend): Session management, Nerin orchestration, Analyzer/Scorer, cost tracking
- **Epic 3** (OCEAN System): Code generation, archetype lookup
- **Parallel:** Integration testing setup (Story 7.2)

## Phase 3: User Experience (Weeks 6-8)
- **Epic 4** (Frontend UI): Auth modal, conversation component, session resumption, optimistic updates
- **Parallel:** Component documentation (Story 7.4) as components are built

## Phase 4: Launch Features (Weeks 9-10)
- **Epic 5** (Results & Profile Sharing): Results display, shareable links
- **Parallel:** E2E testing (Story 7.3) to validate complete user flows

## Phase 5: Security & Compliance (Weeks 11-12)
- **Epic 6** (Privacy & Data): Encryption, GDPR compliance, audit logging

## Critical Path Dependencies

## Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Unit test coverage ≥100% for domain logic
- [ ] API response latency P95 <2 sec for Nerin, <100ms for archetype lookups
- [ ] Session resume time <1 second
- [ ] Daily LLM cost ≤$75
- [ ] Assessment completion rate ≥70%
