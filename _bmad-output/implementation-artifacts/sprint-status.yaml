# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

12. 🆕 **READY:** Story 3.0 - Migrate Tests to Vitest Mock Modules (test infrastructure refactoring)
13. 🆕 **READY:** Story 3.1 - OCEAN code generation (pure algorithm, 250+ tests planned)
14. **MILESTONE:** Epic 2 (Assessment Backend Services) COMPLETE - All backend services operational
15. **NEXT:** Story 3.0 - Test migration, then Story 3.1 - Begin Epic 3 (OCEAN Archetype System)

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Story 3.0 (Test Migration) ready for immediate start - pure test infrastructure refactoring, no production code changes
- Story 3.1 (OCEAN Code Generator) ready for immediate start - pure utility function, no Epic 2 blocking
- Story 7.2 (Integration Testing) can be started in parallel with Epic 2
- Design work for Epic 4 (Frontend UI) can begin now (wireframes, component specs)
