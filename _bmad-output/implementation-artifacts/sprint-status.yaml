# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

## Critical Path Dependencies
```
Epic 1 (Infrastructure) COMPLETE
  |-> Epic 2 (Backend Services) COMPLETE
  |    |-> Epic 3 (Archetypes) COMPLETE
  |    |    |-> Epic 4 (Frontend) UNBLOCKED - READY TO START
  |    |         |-> Epic 5 (Sharing) BLOCKED (needs Epic 4 complete)
  |    |         |-> Epic 6 (Privacy) BLOCKED (needs Epic 4 complete)
  |    |-> Epic 7 (Testing) IN PROGRESS (7.1 done, can parallelize 7.2)
  |-> Epic 7 (Testing) 7.1 COMPLETE
```

## Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Unit test coverage >=100% for domain logic (Story 7.1 framework ready)
- [ ] API response latency P95 <2 sec for Nerin, <100ms for archetype lookups
- [x] Session resume time <1 second (VERIFIED: 19ms with 103 messages)
- [ ] Daily LLM cost <=$75 (Story 2.5 tracking implemented)
- [ ] Assessment completion rate >=70%

## Current Focus & Next Steps

**Current Sprint:** Phase 3 - User Experience (Epic 4 in progress!)
**Active Epics:** Epic 4 (Frontend UI), Epic 7 (Testing)
**Just Completed:** Story 4.1 - Authentication UI (Sign-Up Modal) - ✅ DONE!
**Next Up:** Story 4.2 - Assessment Conversation Component
**Completed Stories:** 23/34 (68% complete)

**Story 4.1 Completion Summary:**
- ✅ SignUpModal component implemented with dark theme
- ✅ Unit tests: 15/15 passing (100% coverage)
- ✅ Form validation (email format, 12+ char password)
- ✅ Session linking via anonymousSessionId
- ✅ Modal triggers after first user message
- ⚠️ E2E tests blocked by CORS (see Task #1)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **✅ STORY 4.1 COMPLETE:** Ready for Story 4.2
2. **NEXT:** Run `dev-story 4.2` to implement Assessment Conversation Component
3. **Backend Task:** Task #1 created to add CORS configuration (unblocks E2E tests)
4. **Parallel:** Story 7.2 (Integration Testing) can continue alongside Epic 4

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Story 4.2 can start immediately - all UI dependencies satisfied
- Task #1 (CORS config) is quick backend work to unblock E2E tests
- Story 7.2 (Integration Testing with real DB) can run in parallel
- Design work for Epic 5 (Results & Sharing) can begin now (wireframes, component specs)
