# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

## Critical Path Dependencies
```
Epic 1 (Infrastructure) ✅ COMPLETE
  ├─→ Epic 2 (Backend Services) ✅ COMPLETE (All stories done!)
  │    ├─→ Epic 3 (Archetypes) 🔄 IN PROGRESS (3.0 done, 3.1 done, 3.2 next)
  │    │    └─→ Epic 4 (Frontend) ⏳ BLOCKED (needs Epic 3 complete)
  │    │         ├─→ Epic 5 (Sharing) ⏳ BLOCKED (needs Epic 4 complete)
  │    │         └─→ Epic 6 (Privacy) ⏳ BLOCKED (needs Epic 4 complete)
  │    └─→ Epic 7 (Testing) 🔄 IN PROGRESS (7.1 done, can parallelize 7.2)
  └─→ Epic 7 (Testing) ✅ 7.1 COMPLETE
```

## Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Unit test coverage >=100% for domain logic (Story 7.1 framework ready)
- [ ] API response latency P95 <2 sec for Nerin, <100ms for archetype lookups
- [x] Session resume time <1 second (**VERIFIED: 19ms with 103 messages**)
- [ ] Daily LLM cost <=$75 (Story 2.5 tracking implemented)
- [ ] Assessment completion rate >=70%

## Current Focus & Next Steps

**Current Sprint:** Phase 2 - Backend Logic (finishing Epic 3)
**Active Epics:** Epic 3 (OCEAN System), Epic 7 (Testing)
**Just Completed:** Story 3.1 - Generate 5-Letter OCEAN Codes from Trait Scores
**Next Up:** Story 3.2 - Create and Manage Archetype Lookup Table (last story in Epic 3!)
**Completed Stories:** 21/34 (62% complete)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ✅ Story 3.0 COMPLETE - Test mock migration to __mocks__ folders with vi.mock() pattern
2. ✅ Story 3.1 COMPLETE - 5-Letter OCEAN code generation from trait scores
3. 🆕 **NEXT:** Story 3.2 - Create and Manage Archetype Lookup Table (4-letter naming, TDD)
4. **MILESTONE:** Epic 3 is 2/3 complete - one story remaining to finish the OCEAN Archetype System
5. **After Epic 3:** Epic 4 (Frontend Assessment UI) becomes unblocked

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Story 3.2 (Archetype Lookup) ready for immediate start - depends on Story 3.1 which is now done
- Story 7.2 (Integration Testing) can be started in parallel with Epic 3
- Design work for Epic 4 (Frontend UI) can begin now (wireframes, component specs)
