# Trait Stack — Copy Deck (Version A)

**Voice:** Nerin — a knowledgeable friend. Conversational, warm, precise. Never clinical, never dumbed down.

**Pattern:** One sentence that reframes the construct. One sentence that makes you feel seen.

## Openness

**Trait description:** How hungry your mind is. Some people crave new ideas like oxygen — others prefer what they already know and trust.

| Facet | Description |
|---|---|
| **Imagination** | How much your mind wanders into "what if" territory. The daydreamers, the world-builders. |
| **Artistic Interests** | Whether beauty stops you in your tracks — music, art, a particular light. Not talent. Sensitivity. |
| **Emotionality** | How tuned in you are to your own feelings. Not how emotional you are — how much you notice it. |
| **Adventurousness** | The new restaurant or the usual? A different route or the known one? Your comfort with unfamiliar territory. |
| **Intellect** | Not IQ — intellectual hunger. Do abstract ideas energize you, or do you prefer thinking that leads somewhere practical? |
| **Liberalism** | How willing you are to re-examine what you already believe. Your tolerance for having your assumptions challenged. |

## Conscientiousness

**Trait description:** Your inner project manager. How you handle deadlines, messy rooms, and the gap between what you planned and what you actually did.

| Facet | Description |
|---|---|
| **Self-Efficacy** | Your gut feeling about whether you can handle what's in front of you. Confidence isn't personality — but this kind is. |
| **Orderliness** | Whether your desk has a system — or IS the system. How much chaos costs you energy. |
| **Dutifulness** | How heavy the word "should" sits in your vocabulary. Whether promises keep you up at night. |
| **Achievement Striving** | The gap between "good enough" and "my best." How much that gap bothers you. |
| **Self-Discipline** | The boring superpower. Can you stay on task when the task isn't interesting? That's this. |
| **Cautiousness** | How long you sit with a decision before making it. Impulsive vs. deliberate — and where you land. |

## Extraversion

**Trait description:** Not "are you loud at parties." It's where your battery charges — around people, or away from them — and what you do with that energy.

| Facet | Description |
|---|---|
| **Friendliness** | How quickly warmth shows up. Some people are warm in 30 seconds, others in 30 days. Both are real. |
| **Gregariousness** | Not just "do you like people" — do you actively seek the crowd? Or do you pick your three and go deep? |
| **Assertiveness** | How naturally you take space in a room. Whether influence feels like effort or instinct. |
| **Activity Level** | Your idle speed. Some people's rest looks like other people's hustle. This measures the engine, not the output. |
| **Excitement Seeking** | Where your threshold is for "enough stimulation." Roller coasters vs. books. Or maybe both. |
| **Cheerfulness** | Your emotional default state. Not whether you're happy right now — whether happiness is where your mood naturally returns to. |

## Agreeableness

**Trait description:** The tension between being kind and being honest. How you navigate that says more about you than almost anything else.

| Facet | Description |
|---|---|
| **Trust** | Your default setting with strangers. Some people start at 100 and subtract. Others start at zero and make you earn it. |
| **Morality** | Your relationship with the straight line between thinking and saying. Some people filter everything. Others can't. |
| **Altruism** | Whether helping feels like a choice or a reflex. The difference matters. |
| **Cooperation** | What happens when you disagree. Do you push back, or find the overlap? Your reflex, not your strategy. |
| **Modesty** | How loudly you take credit. Not low self-esteem — whether self-promotion feels natural or physically uncomfortable. |
| **Sympathy** | How much other people's pain becomes yours. The spectrum between empathic sponge and emotional Teflon. |

---

## Neuroticism

**Trait description:** How your nervous system is wired. Not a flaw. The people who feel things the most intensely often understand the world the deepest.

| Facet | Description |
|---|---|
| **Anxiety** | How loud the "what could go wrong" voice is. Everyone has one. This measures the volume. |
| **Anger** | How short the fuse is — and what lights it. Not whether you're angry now, but how easily you get there. |
| **Depression** | Your vulnerability to low moods. Not clinical depression — the tendency to dip into guilt, sadness, or hopelessness when things go sideways. |
| **Self-Consciousness** | How aware you are of being watched. The volume knob on "what do they think of me?" |
| **Immoderation** | How hard it is to stop once you've started — food, scrolling, spending, whatever your thing is. Impulse control, unfiltered. |
| **Vulnerability** | How stress lands on you. Some people absorb impact like a sponge. Others bounce back fast. This measures the absorption rate. |
