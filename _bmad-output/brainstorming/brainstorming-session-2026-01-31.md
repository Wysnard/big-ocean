# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Vincentlay
**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Documentation and package maintenance strategies

**Goals:** Define update strategies and timing, establish maintenance processes, balance freshness with stability

### Session Setup

We're exploring strategies for maintaining documentation and package dependencies. The focus is on finding the right balance between keeping things current while maintaining stability, and establishing clear processes for when and how updates should occur.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Documentation and package maintenance strategies with focus on defining update strategies, timing, and processes

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming (Phase 1):** Clarifies the problem space by generating critical questions about what needs updating, update frequency metrics, and risk factors
2. **Morphological Analysis (Phase 2):** Maps all parameters and combinations across documentation types, package categories, update frequencies, and testing requirements
3. **Six Thinking Hats (Phase 3):** Views the emerging strategy through 6 distinct lenses (facts, risks, benefits, emotions, creativity, process)
4. **Resource Constraints (Phase 4):** Designs realistic, maintainable processes within actual resource limitations

**AI Rationale:** This 4-phase sequence moves from problem definition to comprehensive mapping to multi-perspective review to reality-based implementation. The progression ensures your maintenance strategy is well-defined, systematically explored, thoroughly vetted from multiple angles, and pragmatically grounded in real-world constraints.
