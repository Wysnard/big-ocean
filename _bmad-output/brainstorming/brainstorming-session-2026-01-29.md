# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Vincentlay
**Date:** 2026-01-29

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Building a psychological profiling platform centered on Big Five framework with conversational assessment, memorable archetypes, scientific research integration, and social features

**Goals:**
- Create accuracy through dialogue depth
- Position Big Five as superior to MBTI
- Make psychology engaging/relatable
- Enable comparison and discovery

### Session Context

This session focuses on a revolutionary approach to personality profiling that combines:
1. Conversational assessment (chatbot that dialogues to identify traits and motivations)
2. Personalized archetypes (memorable profiles like "Mindful Architect," "Lone Wolf")
3. Scientific education hub (peer-reviewed research contextualizing results)
4. Social features (profile comparison and personality matching)

The core insight: Users don't just want scores—they want to understand the science behind their personality and connect with others.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Psychology platform innovation with focus on conversational depth, archetype design, research integration, and competitive differentiation

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Phase 1: First Principles Thinking** — Strip away assumptions about personality assessment to rebuild from psychological bedrock
- **Phase 2: Role Playing** — Explore the challenge from five stakeholder perspectives (researcher, user, founder, competitor, customer)
- **Phase 3: Solution Matrix** — Map how platform dimensions (conversational depth, archetypes, research, social features) combine strategically

**AI Rationale:** Your challenge requires genuine innovation beyond existing questionnaire models. First Principles establishes what personality assessment should fundamentally be. Role Playing ensures you capture all stakeholder needs (scientific rigor, user relevance, business viability). Solution Matrix reveals which platform elements amplify each other and where gaps exist—critical for a multi-dimensional platform like this.

## Brainstorming Execution

### Phase 1: First Principles Thinking

**Duration:** 20 minutes

We're starting by questioning all assumptions about personality assessment. What's actually true about human psychology? What's fundamental?
