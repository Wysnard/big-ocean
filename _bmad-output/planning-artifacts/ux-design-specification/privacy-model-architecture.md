# Privacy Model Architecture

## Three Distinct Privacy Tiers

### 1. Private Profile (User-Only, 100% Confidential)
- Full conversation history with Nerin
- Detailed personality justifications and stories collected by LLM
- All 30 Big Five facets with nuanced insights
- Personal notes and reflection points from assessment
- **Visibility:** User only — zero visibility beyond authenticated account
- **Sharing:** Not shareable, not exportable, not visible in any public form

### 2. Public Archetype (Broad, Shareable)
- Archetype name (e.g., "The Thoughtful Creator")
- Big Five trait scores (simplified to 3-level: Low/Mid/High based on 0-20 scale)
- Facet summaries (no justifications, no detailed explanations)
- Visual archetype representation (icon/color)
- Brief archetype description (~2-3 sentences)
- **Visibility:** Only visible when user explicitly generates shareable link
- **Sharing:** Intended for sharing via unique link

### 3. Shareable Link Profile (What Recipients See)
- Public archetype information only (name, traits, visuals, brief summary)
- No conversation details or personal stories
- No detailed facet justifications
- Broad personality snapshot, not deep dive
- Recipient sees archetype, not the user's personal data
- **Tracking:** Silent engagement tracking (link clicks, views) — not shown to user
- **Future Privacy Controls:** Phase 2 adds on/off toggle for granular visibility settings

## Privacy-First Principle

Users are **private by default, shareable by choice.** Any sharing requires explicit user action (generating a link). No automatic visibility, no discovery directory, no profile recommendations.
