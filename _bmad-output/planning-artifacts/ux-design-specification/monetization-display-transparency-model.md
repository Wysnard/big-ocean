---

## In-Assessment Display Rules (Free & Paid)

**Principle:** Scores remain hidden during conversation to maintain assessment integrity and prevent user bias.

**During Conversation (All Users):**

✅ **SHOW:**
- Precision meter (understanding completeness %)
- Precision updates every 2-3 messages (34% → 41% → 56%...)
- Milestone notifications ("You're now 50% understood")
- Nerin's conversational guidance and coaching

❌ **HIDE:**
- Individual facet scores (no real-time score watching)
- Big Five trait scores (no "You're high in openness" previews)
- Archetype name or hints (no teasing results)
- Any indication of score "direction" (high/low on traits)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents bias:** Users can't "perform" toward desired scores
- **Maintains authenticity:** Responses stay genuine, not strategic
- **Preserves scientific integrity:** Assessment accuracy depends on unbiased responses
- **Consistent experience:** Free and paid users both benefit from this pattern

**This applies to:**
- ✅ Initial 30-minute assessment (pre-70%)
- ✅ Continued conversation post-payment (70% → 85%+)
- ✅ All future sessions (returning users)

---

## Results Page Transparency (Free & Paid)

**When Users Visit Results Page:**

✅ **Always Visible (Free & Paid):**
- Complete archetype profile with all facet scores
- Big Five trait summary
- Precision percentage (current understanding level)
- Facet descriptions and scientific context

✅ **Paid-Only Features:**
- Evidence transparency panel ("show your work")
- Clickable facet scores → view supporting conversation quotes
- Confidence-weighted highlights (green/yellow/red color coding)
- Bidirectional navigation (profile ↔ evidence ↔ messages)

**Design Pattern:**
- Scores update when user **returns to results page**, not during conversation
- This creates a reward moment: "Let me see how my profile evolved"
- Prevents real-time score chasing during conversation
- Results page becomes the celebration space

---

## Conversion Messaging Principles

**Goal:** Subtle invitation to continue, not FOMO manipulation.

**Messaging Strategy at 70% Precision:**

✅ **DO:**
- Celebrate completion: "Your personality profile is complete!"
- Show value of free tier: "Valid, shareable, scientifically-grounded"
- Create curiosity: "Want to understand the *why* behind your scores?"
- Clear one-time pricing: "[PRICE TBD] unlocks unlimited exploration"
- Invitation tone: "Continue exploring" / "Go deeper"

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use FOMO language: "Limited time" / "See what you're missing"
- Imply withholding: "Unlock full profile" / "See hidden results"
- Create pressure: Countdown timers, urgency tactics
- Oversell: Aggressive marketing copy, exaggerated claims

**Example Conversion UI:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎉 Your Personality Profile is Complete        │
│                                                  │

│  │ [Continue Exploring - [PRICE TBD]]        │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                  │
│  [Share Your Archetype] (Free, always visible) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Both CTAs (Continue / Share) have equal visual weight
- No manipulation through button size, color urgency, or placement
- Premium CTA is above free CTA, but not disproportionately emphasized
- Pricing shown clearly (transparency, no hidden costs)

---

## Post-Payment Experience

**After User Pays [PRICE TBD]:**

**Conversation Resumes:**
- User returns to chat interface with Nerin
- Same hidden-score pattern continues (scores not visible during chat)
- Precision meter visible and updating
- Nerin explores deeper contexts (relationships, work, stress)

**Results Page Access:**
- User can switch to results page anytime
- Sees updated scores reflecting continued conversation
- Evidence transparency now active ("show your work" feature)
- Precision evolution tracked (70% → 78% → 84%...)

**Unlimited Sessions:**
- No limits on conversation length
- Can return days/weeks later to continue
- Session state persists indefinitely
- Each return deepens understanding

**Why Scores Stay Hidden During Conversation:**
- Maintains assessment integrity (even for paid users)
- Prevents "score chasing" behavior
- Users who paid already trust this model (they liked free experience)
- Results page becomes the reward moment for exploration

**If Users Ask:** *"I paid, why can't I see scores while chatting?"*

**Response:**
> "We keep scores hidden during conversation—even for premium users—to help you stay authentic and avoid 'performing' for the assessment. Your results update every time you return to your profile page, showing how your understanding deepens over time. This maintains the scientific integrity of the Big Five assessment."

## Design Implications for Assessment Integrity

**Why Hidden Scores Matter (Psychometric Principle):**

When users see partial scores mid-assessment, they may:
- **Anchor** on early signals ("I'm scoring high in openness")
- **Perform** toward or against scores ("I should say something creative")
- **Self-censor** if they dislike the direction ("I don't want to seem neurotic")
- **Optimize** responses to achieve desired archetype

**How We Prevent This:**
- Show **precision** (completeness %), not **scores** (trait values)
- Precision = motivation without bias ("The assessment is working")
- Results revealed only when profile is valid (70%+)
- Post-payment: Same pattern continues (maintains consistency)

**Nerin's Language During Assessment:**

✅ **Neutral Exploratory Questions:**
- "How do you approach tasks with lots of moving parts?"
- "Tell me about a time you had to make a tough decision"

❌ **Obvious Trait Language:**
- "You seem very organized and detail-oriented" (telegraphs conscientiousness)
- "Are you an introvert or extravert?" (reveals assessment dimension)

**If User Asks for Scores Mid-Assessment:**

User: "What's my score so far?" or "Can you tell me my personality type yet?"

**Nerin Response:**
> "I'm definitely seeing patterns, but I don't want to share partial insights that might not be accurate yet. Right now we're at 45% precision—let's get to 70%+ so I can give you the full picture. Trust the process?"

**Tone:** Transparent about *why* scores are hidden (accuracy, not gatekeeping).
