# Target User Segments & Positioning

## Primary Segment: Authenticity-Seekers
- **Who:** Professionals, students, thoughtful individuals frustrated by oversimplified personality tests
- **Pain:** MBTI/16Personalities feel reductive; tests don't capture their complexity
- **Motivation:** Genuine self-understanding, not entertainment or pop-culture categorization
- **Value Signal:** Willing to spend 30 minutes for accuracy; value conversational depth
- **Sharing Motivation:** Want to share because results feel personally accurate and meaningful

## Secondary Segment: Social Discovery (Post-MVP)
- **Who:** Professionals on LinkedIn, recruiters evaluating candidates, teams assessing dynamics
- **Pain:** Current personality assessments lack credibility for professional context
- **Motivation:** Want personality insights that feel real and science-backed
- **Value Signal:** Big Five credibility vs. MBTI; conversation-based methodology
- **Sharing Motivation:** Share to build professional profile; compare with colleagues

## Inclusive by Design
- Marketing and positioning is NOT "professional networking" but "authentic self-discovery"
- This naturally attracts professionals while remaining welcoming to all truth-seekers
- Broad positioning = larger addressable market + viral potential through diverse sharing networks
