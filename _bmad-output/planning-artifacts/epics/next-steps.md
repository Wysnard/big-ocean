# Next Steps

This epic and story breakdown is now ready for implementation. The sequence is:

1. **Epic 1** - Infrastructure & Auth (foundational, enables all others)
2. **Epic 2** - Assessment Backend (core logic)
3. **Epic 3** - OCEAN Archetype System (results)
4. **Epic 4** - Frontend UI (user experience + component documentation)
5. **Epic 5** - Profile Sharing (viral growth)
6. **Epic 6** - Privacy & Data (compliance) — Phase 2
7. **Epic 7** - UI Theme & Visual Identity (14 stories: brand tokens → auth gate → social sharing → final polish) — Phase 1
8. **Epic 8** - Results Page Content Enrichment (archetype/trait/facet descriptions + personalized portraits)

Each epic contains detailed, implementable stories with clear acceptance criteria. Stories are sized for 2-5 day implementation cycles.

**Note on Testing:** Testing is integrated into implementation via TDD (Test-Driven Development) pattern. Each story includes comprehensive test coverage in its acceptance criteria following red-green-refactor cycle.

**Document Status:** Merged from epics.md, epic-7-ui-theming.md, and epic-8-results-page-content-enrichment.md on 2026-02-13. All epics contain full detailed specifications.
