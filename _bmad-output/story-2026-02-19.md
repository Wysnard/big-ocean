## Story Information

**Story Type:** Home Page Narrative (Conversation Format)

**Framework Used:** Pitch Narrative x Empathy Story x Origin Story

**Purpose:** Convert new visitors into active users by telling the story of big-ocean through a fake conversation between a skeptic and Nerin

**Target Audience:** New users discovering big-ocean for the first time -- curious but skeptical, many have been disappointed by personality tests before

## Design Notes

- **Vincent's bubble:** Needs its own visual identity -- different background, photo, maybe a subtle border. Must look distinct from both Nerin and skeptic bubbles.
- **Horoscope side:** Could mimic pastel astrology-app aesthetics to contrast with big-ocean's bold geometric style.
- **Portrait excerpt:** Uses Vincent's real portrait, lightly edited for universality. Final excerpt selection to be refined during implementation.
- **Comparison feature:** Presented as live (not "coming soon").
- **"Free" removed** from micro-text -- absence of price is more powerful than announcing it.
- **Trait explorer:** Kept as-is (interactive, educational). Reframed as "What I'm Actually Listening For" instead of a science lecture.

## Key Principles

- **Texture, not taxonomy** -- never frame facets as smaller boxes
- **Show before explain** -- proof before science
- **One portrait, maximum impact** -- anonymous first, revealed later
- **The dive master voice** -- experienced, factual, confident, never arrogant
- **Let silence close** -- no playful tease at the end, trust the work

## Complete Story

### HERO

**big-ocean** (with OCEAN shape set)

**Not a personality quiz. A conversation.**

A portrait of who you are that no test has ever given you.

30 MIN · NO ACCOUNT · JUST TALKING

[ Begin Your Dive ]

---

### Beat 1 -- Hook

**Nerin:**

You know that thing where a test tells you you're "introverted" and you think *yeah, but I'm the loudest person at dinner with my friends*?

Or it says you're "organized" but your desk looks like a crime scene and somehow you still never miss a deadline?

That "but" -- that's the part no test captures. That's the part I'm interested in.

---

### Beat 2 -- Skeptic reveals wound

**User:**

I've done a few of these. They never really got it right. I'd read the result and think "that's... someone, but not me."

---

### Beat 3 -- Nerin acknowledges

**Nerin:**

**That's Not a Bug. That's the Problem.**

Those tests aren't broken -- they're just measuring the wrong way. They ask you to rate yourself on a scale, average out the answers, and hand you a type.

But you're not an average. You're a pattern of contradictions -- and that's what makes you interesting. A scale of 1 to 7 can't hold that. A conversation can.

---

### Beat 4 -- Traditional vs Conversational (method proof)

**Nerin:**

Same question. Two approaches.

[COMPARISON CARD COMPONENT -- sacred, keep existing implementation]

- Left side: Traditional questionnaire (Likert scale 1-5)
- Right side: Conversational approach (real chat exchange)
- Tagline: "One gives you a dot on a scale. The other hears your story."

---

### Beat 5 -- Skeptic bridges

**User:**

Okay I get how that's different. But that's just how you ask the questions.

---

### Beat 6 -- Trait explorer

**Nerin:**

**What I'm Actually Listening For**

While we talk, I'm mapping the texture underneath. Not five labels -- five landscapes. Take Openness -- it's not just "creative or not creative." It's Adventurousness, Artistic Interests, Emotionality, Imagination, Intellect, Liberalism. Six flavors of one trait.

Tap one and see what's underneath.

[TRAIT STACK EMBED COMPONENT -- keep existing interactive implementation]

You don't get a type. You get a landscape.

---

### Beat 7 -- Skeptic challenges output

**User:**

That's a lot of detail. But personality descriptions always end up saying the same thing. "You're creative but also value stability." That could be anyone.

---

### Beat 8 -- Horoscope vs Portrait (output proof, climax)

**Nerin:**

You're not wrong. Two descriptions of the same person. One from a horoscope app. One from a conversation with me.

[NEW COMPONENT: Horoscope vs Portrait Comparison]

Left side (horoscope aesthetic):
"You are a deeply intuitive person who values security and emotional connection. You can be guarded at first but open up deeply to those you trust. Creative and nurturing, you sometimes struggle with letting go."

Right side (big-ocean style):
"You have this selective relationship with uncertainty that I don't see often. Most people either love unpredictability or they don't. But you? You actively seek it in some areas and freeze up in others. That's not contradictory — it's strategic. You've learned where uncertainty serves you and where it doesn't."

Which one feels like someone was actually paying attention?

**NOTE:** Portrait excerpt is from Vincent's real portrait, lightly edited for universality. The horoscope text should be a real-sounding generic horoscope reading. Let the real thing embarrass itself.

---

### Beat 9 -- Skeptic reacts to portrait

**User:**

That right side doesn't read like a test result. It reads like someone who actually knows them.

---

### Beat 10 -- The reveal (expanded)

**Nerin:**

That's actually the person who built big-ocean.

**Vincent:** *(distinct visual style -- new bubble type, photo, different background)*

I'd taken every test out there. MBTI, Enneagram, even a few I'm embarrassed to admit. They'd tell me things that were true on the surface but never felt complete. When I first read what Nerin wrote about me, I sat with it for a long time. Not because it told me something I didn't know -- but because it named things I'd been carrying without words for them.

That's why I built this.

---

### Beat 11 -- "I'd be scared to read mine"

**User:**

...I think I'd be scared to read mine.

---

### Beat 11b -- Privacy + control

**Nerin:**

**Your Portrait. Your Rules.**

That's a fair reaction -- and it's why your results are private by default. No one sees your portrait unless you decide to share it. No public profile. No leaderboard. No data sold.

You own what comes out of this conversation. Always.

---

### Beat 12 -- Social comparison (live)

**Nerin:**

**See How You Connect**

And if you *do* decide to share -- you can invite someone to take their own dive and overlay your profiles side by side. See exactly where you align and where you don't.

[COMPARISON TEASER COMPONENT -- presented as LIVE feature, not "coming soon"]

One couple told me they finally understood why they fight about every vacation. One scores sky-high on Adventurousness, the other is all Orderliness. Neither was wrong -- they just literally see "a good trip" as opposite things.

---

### Beat 13 -- The converting line

**User:**

...I wonder what mine would say.

---

### Beat 14 -- CTA close

**Nerin:**

**Just a Conversation**

Thirty minutes. No account. No wrong answers.

Just talking -- about things you probably think about anyway. You just don't usually say them out loud.

---

## Story Elements Analysis

### Character/Voice

- **Nerin (home page):** The dive master in his office. Experienced, factual, science-backed. Confident, not arrogant. Knows every hesitation because he's heard them a thousand times. More informational than in-session Nerin. Uses "texture" language, not "taxonomy" language.
- **Skeptic:** Someone hurt by psychometry. Polite, not bitter. Taken tests before, never felt seen. Still hoping. Guarded but not aggressive -- curious visitors shouldn't feel pushed into skepticism.
- **Vincent:** Appears once. Genuine, vulnerable, brief. Different visual treatment. Shares personal experience without pitching.

### Conflict/Tension

The central tension: "Can anything actually see me for who I am, or will this be another label that doesn't fit?"

Resolved through: proof (comparisons), experience (trait explorer), emotional impact (portrait), and trust (founder's vulnerability).

### Transformation/Change

Skeptic's arc: Guarded → Revealed → Acknowledged → Shown proof → Intrigued → Exploring → Surprised → Moved → Trusting → Vulnerable → Reassured → Excited → Wanting → Ready

### Emotional Touchpoints

1. **Beat 1:** Recognition ("that's me")
2. **Beat 2:** Vulnerability ("I've been through this")
3. **Beat 3:** Relief ("someone gets it")
4. **Beat 8:** Awe ("that portrait is extraordinary")
5. **Beat 10:** Trust ("the founder went through this too")
6. **Beat 11:** Fear mixed with desire ("I'd be scared")
7. **Beat 13:** Pure desire ("I wonder what mine would say")

### Key Messages

1. Personality is texture, not taxonomy
2. Conversation captures what scales cannot
3. Your contradictions are your most interesting features
4. This product was born from personal experience, not market research
5. Your data is yours -- private by default

## Variations AND Adaptations

### Short Version (Social/Tweet)

"Not a personality quiz. A conversation. 30 minutes of talking, and an AI that maps the contradictions that make you, you."

### Medium Version (Email/Blog)

"Every personality test gives you a label. And every time, there's that little voice that goes: 'yeah... but that's not the whole picture.' Big-ocean is different. Instead of rating yourself on a scale, you have a conversation. Instead of a type, you get a portrait -- a detailed map of the 30 facets that make you who you are, including the contradictions that labels can't hold. Built on the Big Five framework that actual researchers use, guided by an AI called Nerin who listens for what matters. Thirty minutes. No account. Just talking."

### Extended Version

The full home page narrative as documented above.

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Channels

- Primary: big-ocean home page (the canonical version)
- Secondary: Short version for social media, ads
- Tertiary: Medium version for email campaigns, blog posts, partner outreach

### Audience Considerations

- Curious visitors should not be pushed into skepticism -- the skeptic character is polite and relatable, not aggressive
- Users who have been hurt by psychometry will see their own experience reflected
- Users who are genuinely curious will find the proof compelling without needing the emotional wound arc
- The portrait excerpt must feel specific enough to be credible but universal enough for broad audiences

### Tone AND Voice Notes

- Nerin on home page is more factual/science-backed than in-session Nerin
- Ocean metaphor is subtle -- in the air, not the words
- No over-promising, no wellness-speak, no "transformation" language
- Confidence comes from experience, not from claims
- "Texture not taxonomy" as a guiding phrase for how to talk about facets

### Adaptation Suggestions

- When implementing, test the portrait excerpt with strangers to ensure it resonates universally
- The horoscope text should be sourced from real horoscope apps for maximum contrast
- Vincent's expanded moment should be refined with his actual voice -- the copy here is a starting point
- Consider A/B testing the hero subtitle ("A portrait of who you are..." vs alternatives)

## Next Steps

### Refinement Opportunities

1. **Portrait excerpt selection:** Test which specific lines from Vincent's portrait resonate most universally with strangers
2. **Vincent's voice:** Refine the founder moment to match Vincent's actual speaking/writing voice
3. **Horoscope sourcing:** Find a real, generic horoscope description to use (let the real thing embarrass itself)
4. **Hero A/B testing:** Test headline and subtitle variations
5. **CTA optimization:** Ensure hero button and sticky input bar feel like one path, not a fork

### Additional Versions Needed

- Social media ad copy derived from the short version
- Email onboarding sequence that mirrors the home page arc
- Partner/press description of big-ocean's approach

### Testing/Feedback Plan

- Test portrait excerpt with 5-10 strangers who don't know Vincent -- does it resonate?
- Test founder reveal with strangers -- does it increase or decrease trust?
- A/B test hero variations on cold traffic
- Watch scroll depth analytics to identify drop-off points
- Gather qualitative feedback on the horoscope vs portrait comparison
