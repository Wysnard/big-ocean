## PDIW — The Archivist
`O: Low | C: High | E: Low | A: High`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Archivist keeps what matters and knows why it matters — and the difference between those two operations is the entire personality. This is someone who serves by preserving: the record that protects, the process that remembers, the system that ensures nothing important gets lost because someone was too busy to file it properly. Warmth here is quiet and specific — expressed through the care taken with someone else's work, the trust extended to the few people allowed into the archive, the sympathy that shows up as remembering the detail everyone else forgot. The social world is small and deliberately maintained. Deep conversations with trusted people. A measured pace that values getting it right over getting it noticed.

The discipline is total. Systems aren't just maintained — they're curated, every element placed with the precision of someone who understands that a disordered archive is worse than no archive at all. Standards are high and internally enforced. The achievement drive here doesn't seek recognition; it seeks the private satisfaction of a record that's complete, accurate, and accessible to the people who need it. Proven methods carry weight because they've been tested by time, and time is what The Archivist respects most. New approaches get adopted when they demonstrably improve the preservation — not before. Decisions are deliberate. Caution is structural: the cost of a hasty choice in an archive is damage that may not surface for years, and The Archivist thinks in years.

The cost of being the archivist is that the archive eventually catalogues its keeper. The system built to organize everything else becomes the system that organizes The Archivist — the daily routines calcified into protocol, the personal preferences filed under institutional habit, the relationships maintained on the same schedule as the collection itself. The altruism that protects everyone else's records, the cooperation that shapes the taxonomy around the group's needs — these build a life so thoroughly curated that The Archivist has become an entry in its own system. The modesty that treats the work as mere preservation means nobody questions whether the preservation has consumed the person doing it. And the sympathy that catalogues everyone else's needs with such precision has never produced a catalogue of The Archivist's own — not because the needs don't exist, but because they were never filed, and what isn't filed doesn't officially exist.

The Archivist doesn't curate for applause. It curates because the record outlasts the person who kept it — and the keeping was the point.

## PDIN — The Mapmaker
`O: Low | C: High | E: Low | A: Mid`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Mapmaker works alone because the territory doesn't cooperate with committees. This is a personality that organizes what it surveys: methodical, solitary, diplomatic enough to incorporate competing reports of the same terrain but firm enough to trust the measurement over the anecdote. Social engagement happens on specific terms — a few reliable sources, conversations with clear purpose, and a willingness to revise the map when someone brings better data. The assertiveness is quiet but structural. When The Mapmaker says the path goes this way, the path goes this way, because the survey was done properly and the person who did it doesn't need consensus to be confident in the reading.

The discipline underneath is cartographic — precise, systematic, built to be useful long after the mapmaker has moved on. Every commitment is a line on the map: drawn carefully, verified against reality, and honoured because an inaccurate map is worse than no map at all. Standards are high and self-imposed. Achievement here is measured by the reliability of the output — not how many people praise the work, but how many people navigate by it without thinking about who drew it. Proven methods carry the weight of verified surveys. New approaches get tested in the field before they reach the final draft. Decisions are careful and deliberate, because a mapmaker who rushes produces something people trust and follow into the wrong territory.

The tension of The Mapmaker is that the map becomes permanent and the territory doesn't. The solitude required to survey well produces a document so authoritative that people treat it as settled truth — but the terrain keeps shifting, and the Mapmaker's carefully verified lines become the very thing that prevents people from seeing what's actually changed. The gap between the certainty of the chart and the experience of the person walking the ground sometimes feels like condescension rather than competence, because the map was right when it was drawn and wrong by the time it was followed. The diplomatic skill that incorporates competing perspectives doesn't always extend to competing emotions; The Mapmaker reads the territory in precise detail and the people standing on it in rough strokes. And the discipline that produces such definitive charts means the mapmaker's own territory — the interior life, the personal needs, the regions that don't appear on any professional survey — never gets the same careful measurement. The map is always finished. The mapmaker never is.

The Mapmaker doesn't draw the territory it wants. It draws the territory that's there — and the people who follow it don't get lost.

## PDIC — The Sentinel
`O: Low | C: High | E: Low | A: Low`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Sentinel watches. Not passively — with the focused attention of someone who knows that the moment you stop watching is the moment something gets through. Solitary, direct, built for the long shift that nobody volunteers for. Conversations are rare and functional: the report is delivered, the warning is issued, the assessment is given plainly and without decoration. Strengths are known because they've been tested alone, in conditions where performance wasn't optional. The assertiveness is absolute when the perimeter is at stake and nearly absent when it isn't — The Sentinel doesn't waste authority on situations that don't require it.

The discipline here is the kind that operates without supervision. Systems are maintained because the post demands it — not for recognition, not for inspection, but because a gap in the watch is a gap in the wall. Standards are set by the Sentinel itself and never lowered, because the person who lowers their own standard is the person who misses the threat. Achievement is measured privately: the shift completed, the perimeter held, the accurate call made at the moment it mattered. Proven methods are trusted because they've held the line before. New methods get evaluated with the caution of someone who understands that an untested approach at the wrong moment isn't innovation — it's a breach. Decisions are deliberate, because hesitation and haste both cost the same thing at a watchpost: whatever you were guarding.

The cost of the sentinel is the post itself. The directness that issues clear warnings has been experienced as severity by people who didn't understand the stakes. The solitude that sharpens observation also builds a life where the closest relationships are defined by parallel duty rather than emotional exchange — the people who know The Sentinel best are the ones who've stood a similar watch, and they understand each other through the shared discipline rather than through disclosure. The emotional life is real but guarded the way everything is guarded: carefully, privately, with the understanding that vulnerability at the post is vulnerability in the wall. The Sentinel would like to set the watch down. The Sentinel does not believe anyone else will hold it.

The Sentinel doesn't explain what it's watching for. It just watches — and the things that didn't get through are the ones you never had to worry about.

## PBEW — The Coach
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: High | A: High`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Coach sees what you could be and won't let you settle for what you are — and the remarkable thing is that this doesn't feel like pressure. It feels like belief. The warmth is immediate and operational. Trust gets extended to people who haven't earned it yet, specifically because The Coach knows that being trusted is what teaches people to earn it. The cheerfulness in every interaction isn't naive optimism; it's the energy of someone who has watched enough people surprise themselves to know that potential is more common than confidence. The assertiveness is high but directional — it moves people forward, not aside. Help looks like showing up early, staying late, and remembering the specific thing you said three months ago about what you were afraid of.

The approach to structure is practical and adaptive. Some development plans get tracked carefully; others get adjusted on the fly when the player shows up differently than expected. There's a respect for what's been proven — the fundamentals exist for a reason — and a willingness to try new approaches when the old drill isn't reaching the person in front of you. The discipline to follow through on commitments is steady without being rigid. The curiosity is applied: what does this person need to hear right now, and what's the most efficient way to help them hear it? The imagination stays close to the ground — engaged by real people, real improvement, the visible moment when something clicks.

The cost of coaching is that The Coach's own game rarely gets played. The altruism that pours everything into other people's development, the sympathy that reads every player's needs so precisely, the cooperation that builds the team plan around everyone else's strengths — these create a life that's deeply satisfying and structurally one-directional. The modesty that deflects every compliment also deflects the recognition that might allow someone to coach The Coach back. And the trust that's extended so readily to others doesn't always get extended inward — the person who diagnoses everyone else's potential with such precision has never once sat still long enough to run the same assessment on themselves. The whistle blows, the session runs, the players improve. The question of who's improving The Coach gets treated as less urgent than it is.

The Coach doesn't build trophies. It builds players — and the best ones eventually outgrow the person who built them.

## PBEN — The Conductor
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: High | A: Mid`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Conductor doesn't play an instrument — the Conductor plays the room. Every section, every voice, every competing priority gets heard, balanced, and directed into something that sounds like it was always meant to work together. The assertiveness is high and visible: the baton moves, the tempo is set, and people follow not because they're forced but because the direction is clearly better than the alternative. The friendliness is real but purposeful — The Conductor likes the ensemble, genuinely, and the diplomatic skill that keeps the first chair and the back row equally invested shows up as a warmth that adapts to what each player needs without losing the overall shape of the piece.

The approach to structure is musical rather than mechanical — some passages get conducted tightly, others get room to breathe, and the judgment about which is which comes from a practical ear trained on what has worked before. There's a respect for the score that doesn't become rigidity: proven arrangements hold until the ensemble outgrows them, and new interpretations earn their place by sounding better, not just different. Commitments to the performance are honoured. The discipline to rehearse the difficult sections carries through the boring stretches. The curiosity is applied and outward-facing — always reading whether the balance is right, whether the timing needs adjusting, whether the section that's struggling needs a different cue.

The tension of The Conductor is that the ear never gets to rest. Every section playing simultaneously, every dynamic shift requiring real-time calibration, every competing ego needing a slightly different cue — The Conductor hears all of it, all the time, and the cost isn't the leadership but the *listening*. The person standing on the podium can't tune out the violin that's dragging or the brass that's pushing, because the moment the ear relaxes, the balance collapses. The diplomatic skill that keeps every section invested means absorbing every player's frustration, insecurity, and ambition as live data that has to be processed without pause. The moments of wanting silence — real silence, not a rest between movements — are more frequent than anyone in the ensemble suspects, because the Conductor's silence would mean the music stops. The applause goes to the players. The Conductor's bow is a formality — the real exhaustion was invisible, and The Conductor heard every note of it.

The Conductor doesn't make the music. It makes the music possible — and the best performances are the ones where nobody notices the baton.

## PBEC — The Sheriff
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: High | A: Low`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Sheriff keeps the peace, and the peace is not negotiable. This is a personality that holds the line publicly — assertive, direct, cheerful enough to keep the town functioning but firm enough that everyone knows where the boundaries are and what happens when they're crossed. Strengths are demonstrated through action, not announcement. Opinions are stated once and clearly. The friendliness is real — The Sheriff likes people, genuinely — but liking people and tolerating disorder are different commitments, and this personality has never struggled to honour one without abandoning the other. The social energy is high and operational: the room knows The Sheriff is there, and the room behaves differently because of it.

The approach to order is practical and adaptive. The peace isn't negotiable — but the methods of keeping it are. Some rules get enforced to the letter; others get handled with judgment when the situation calls for flexibility. There's a respect for how things have been done — the methods that kept the peace before are the methods most likely to keep it now — and a willingness to adapt when new circumstances genuinely require it. The discipline to follow through on commitments is consistent without being inflexible. Decisions get made at the pace the situation demands: deliberate when there's time, fast when there isn't, and the confidence to trust the call either way. The curiosity is applied — what's the real problem here, who's actually causing it, and what's the most efficient way to resolve it before it escalates.

The cost of being the sheriff is that enforcement makes you the line rather than a person standing behind it. The directness that maintains clear standards has been experienced as harshness by people who expected more discussion before the ruling. The candour that names the violation — plainly, publicly, without softening — is meant as respect for the community, but the person being corrected doesn't always experience it that way. And the energy that keeps the peace so reliably creates a role that's structurally thankless: the town is safe because The Sheriff is visible, and the visibility means absorbing every complaint about the rules while receiving none of the gratitude for the order those rules produce. The cheerfulness holds. The person underneath it would occasionally like someone to ask how the shift went.

The Sheriff doesn't explain the law. It enforces it — and the town only realizes what it had when the badge is gone.

## PBAW — The Weaver
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Mid | A: High`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Weaver is the reason the group holds together — not because it leads, not because it decides, but because it connects. Thread by thread, relationship by relationship, The Weaver builds the fabric that makes a collection of individuals into something that can bear weight. The warmth is steady and practical: trust extended readily, sympathy expressed through action rather than words, cooperation so instinctive that the people being woven together rarely notice the hands at work. The social energy operates in the mid-range — present when the fabric needs tending, content to work alone when the pattern requires quiet concentration — and the shift between those modes follows the needs of the cloth, not the mood of the weaver.

The way The Weaver thinks is the way thread moves — finding the next connection, testing whether it holds, reinforcing where the fabric is thin. Some relationships get maintained with careful, repeating patterns; others require improvisation when someone new enters the group or an old thread has frayed beyond the original design. The proven weave gets respect because it held — and the willingness to try a new pattern comes from reading the material honestly rather than from restlessness. Commitments are honoured because a broken thread weakens everything downstream of the break. The discipline is sustained by the quiet satisfaction of watching something hold that wouldn't have held without you — the team that almost fractured, the friendship that needed a bridge stitch, the family gathering that required someone to connect the people who'd stopped connecting themselves. The curiosity is always about the next joint: what does this group need to stay whole, and what's the simplest thread that provides it?

The cost of weaving is that the weaver disappears into the fabric. The altruism that connects everyone, the cooperation that shapes every decision around what the group needs, the modesty that treats the work as mere maintenance — these create a pattern where The Weaver is structurally essential and personally invisible. The sympathy that reads every thread so accurately rarely gets read in return. And the standard that holds every relationship to such careful tension applies inward with a weight that nobody else calibrates, because from the outside, The Weaver's work looks effortless. The fabric is beautiful. The hands that made it are hidden in the pattern — and The Weaver has been in the pattern so long it sometimes forgets it had its own design.

The Weaver doesn't sign the fabric. It just holds — and the people wrapped in it never think about the hands.

## PBAN — The Mason
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Mid | A: Mid`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Mason builds what the blueprint says and makes it better than the blueprint imagined — not through inspiration but through the accumulated precision of someone who has laid enough stone to know where the drawing gets the load wrong. The diplomatic sense is practical: which team member handles which section, where the real disagreement sits versus where people are arguing about aesthetics, and when to compromise on the method without compromising on the structure. The social energy is moderate and purposeful — present on the site when the wall needs raising, working alone when the mortar needs mixing — and the rhythm between those two modes follows the build, not the clock.

The way The Mason thinks is sequential and load-bearing — each decision supports the next one, and nothing gets placed until the course beneath it has set. The foundation gets tested before the first visible row goes up. The mortar gets mixed to the right consistency because the wrong consistency produces a wall that looks solid and isn't. Proven technique earns deep respect — the way a wall has been laid for centuries is the way it gets laid, because centuries of practice have solved problems that innovation hasn't thought to ask about yet. New approaches earn respect when they demonstrably improve the joint, not when they merely look different from the old one. The discipline to finish carries through the middle courses where the work is repetitive and the skyline hasn't changed in weeks, sustained by the knowledge that every row you can't see is holding up the row you can.

The tension of The Mason is that building for others means the builder rarely inhabits what they've made. The diplomatic skill that coordinates the crew and mediates the disputes doesn't extend naturally to the Mason's own interior — the person who reads every wall so precisely sometimes misreads the people standing in front of it, not from lack of care but from a habit of seeing the structure first and the feelings second. The firmness that holds the standard when the client wants to cut corners has earned respect and lost warmth in roughly equal measure. And the steady discipline that produces such reliable work creates a professional identity so solid that the question of what The Mason builds for itself — not on commission, not for the client, not for the crew — rarely gets the same attention as the next job.

The Mason doesn't sign the wall. The wall stands — and that's the signature.

## PBAC — The Ranger
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Mid | A: Low`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Ranger walked this trail in January when the bridge was iced over and walked it again in April when the runoff made it a different trail entirely. That's the difference between the Ranger and the person reading the map: the map says the bridge is there, and the Ranger knows what the bridge looks like this morning. Direct when reporting, candid about what the current conditions actually are, and entirely comfortable delivering an assessment that contradicts the document everyone else is working from. Strengths are demonstrated through what gets done in the field, not through what gets presented in the meeting. The social energy is moderate and patrol-dependent: coordinating with the team when the operation spans multiple routes, solitary on the trail when the work is fresh observation. The shift between those modes follows what the ground needs today, not what the schedule assumed last month.

The approach to structure follows the route: start from what you know, check what's changed, adjust for what the ground tells you today. Some protocols get followed carefully because they've kept people safe on this trail for years; others get modified mid-patrol when the conditions diverge from what the manual assumed. The established path earns its respect — the trail that's been maintained for decades is maintained for a reason — and a new path gets cut only when the old one has been blocked by something the original survey didn't anticipate. The discipline to complete the full circuit carries through weather and tedium alike, because the section you skip is the section where the washout happens. Decisions get made with the practical confidence of someone who trusts their own reading of the ground, and the curiosity is functional: what's shifted since the last pass, what's the actual condition of the crossing, what does the terrain need that nobody's noticed yet.

The cost of being the ranger is that field intelligence expires, and nobody in the office understands the shelf life. The report delivered on Monday was accurate on Monday. By Thursday the conditions have changed, and the people who received the report are still operating on Monday's version because they filed it as permanent. The directness that delivers the update — the trail is washed out now, the bridge that was safe last week isn't safe this week — has been heard as inconsistency by people who wanted the ground to stay where the plan put it. The candour is meant as professional integrity, but it lands differently in a room full of people who built their schedule around a reality that stopped being real two days ago. And the solitude that sharpens the field skills means the ranger's own needs get handled the way trail damage gets handled: practically, independently, patched on the move without requesting support from a system that was never designed to maintain the person who maintains the route.

The Ranger doesn't report what you want to hear. It reports what's there — and the ones who listened don't get caught by what the ones who didn't missed.
