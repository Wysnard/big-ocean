# Archetype Descriptions — Batch 9 (PFA + PFI) — FINAL BATCH

All P-register: direct, concrete prose, zero-Google names.
PF = F modifier (light, fragments, asides, associative tangents). C:Low (free, scrappy, improvised).
PFA = E:Mid. PFI = E:Low.

Style guide v2: shadow rule, E+A leads, name-related metaphors, E-Mid variety, A-Mid switch points, A-Low friction, no "genuine", no "moral seriousness".

A-axis key: W = defined by who they serve, N = defined by what they organize, C = defined by what they hold to.

Key differentiations tracked:
- Mender vs Weaver: Mender repairs what's broken; Weaver connects what's separate
- Fixer vs Trader: Fixer solves problems at team scale; Trader makes exchanges at public scale
- Scout vs Ranger: Scout is flexible/improvisational; Ranger is steady/methodical
- Gardener vs Shepherd: Gardener grows from seed, private; Shepherd tends what already lives, flock-scale
- Tinker vs Craftsman: Tinker improvises from scraps; Craftsman follows the grain with precision
- Maverick vs Sentinel: Maverick operates by own rules; Sentinel holds the line for others

The Mender shows up after the damage. Not during — after. When the crisis has passed. The emergency responders have moved on. Everyone assumes the situation is handled. That's when The Mender arrives, because what's actually broken only becomes visible once the adrenaline clears. Warm, practical, operating at whatever scale the repair requires — sometimes the whole group, sometimes one person, sometimes just the quiet work of putting something back together that nobody else noticed had come apart. The trust is immediate and specific: not "I believe in you" but "hand me that, hold this, we're fixing it now." Strengths show up as competence under unglamorous conditions. The assertiveness is moderate and repair-shaped — firm enough to say what needs doing, flexible enough to change the plan when the break turns out to be somewhere other than where it looked.

First thing through the door: triage. Not the dramatic kind. The practical kind. What's load-bearing? What can wait? What looks damaged but is actually fine — and what looks fine but isn't? That last one. That's where The Mender earns it. Some repairs follow a careful sequence because the structural integrity depends on getting the order right. Others get improvised on the spot. The patch that holds long enough to get to the real fix. The workaround nobody planned for but everyone ends up relying on. The approach is adaptive by necessity — the broken thing doesn't care about your preferred method, it cares about what makes it hold again. The curiosity is diagnostic: what actually failed here, not what everyone thinks failed. Different question. Usually different answer.

The cost of mending is that the mender becomes the person the broken things find. The warmth that shows up so reliably after the damage — the sympathy, the cooperation, the instinct to repair what others abandon — these build a role that's structurally reactive. The Mender is brilliant at fixing what breaks and rarely present for what isn't broken, because the unbroken things don't need The Mender and The Mender has learned to go where needed. The trust extended so readily to damaged situations doesn't always extend to undamaged ones — the dinner party where nothing needs repairing, the friendship that's working fine, the evening where the only task is enjoyment. Those moments feel like waiting. And the flexibility that improvises repairs so brilliantly has never built a structure of its own — not from lack of skill, but because the next break always arrives before the personal project gets past the foundation.

The Mender doesn't fix what isn't broken. But what's broken finds The Mender — and it always holds.

The Fixer gets called when the normal channels didn't work. Somebody needs something done — not someday, not through the proper process, not after the committee meets. Now. And The Fixer knows who to call, which favour to use, what angle makes the locked door open without anyone having to break it. Diplomatic but unsentimental. The assertiveness is calibrated: high enough to push past the obstacle, measured enough to leave the relationship intact for next time. Social engagement runs at the mid-range — present in the network when the situation requires navigation, comfortable working alone when the problem is mechanical rather than political. The shift between people-mode and problem-mode is seamless. Whichever one gets the thing done is the one that runs.

Speed and leverage. That's the calculus. The problem that'll get worse if it waits goes first. Clean solution? Goes second. Eight meetings and a policy change? Filed under "not actually a fix." Some solutions follow established channels — The Fixer respects process when process works, which is more often than cynics assume and less often than bureaucrats insist. Others go around. Not deception. Practical recognition that the shortest distance between a problem and a solution isn't always the org chart. The approach is improvisational and results-oriented. Whatever delivers, delivers. Whatever's been blocked by someone who values procedure over outcome gets routed around. The curiosity is mechanical: what's actually stuck, what's the minimum intervention that unsticks it, and who owes a favour that makes the intervention possible.

The cost of fixing is that the workaround becomes the system. Every shortcut The Fixer takes — the favour called in, the process bypassed, the solution that went around the obstacle instead of through it — works beautifully once. Then it works again. Then people start relying on it. And now the temporary fix is load-bearing infrastructure that only The Fixer understands, because The Fixer built it on the fly and never documented it, because documenting a workaround would mean admitting it was permanent. The diplomatic skill that navigates around obstacles doesn't always distinguish between obstacles that should be navigated around and structures that existed for a reason — and the structures that got bypassed don't rebuild themselves once the shortcut is established. The network runs on reciprocity. Every favour banked is a favour owed, and the ledger never closes. The Fixer is indispensable. That's the problem. Indispensable means the system breaks when you leave — and The Fixer built the system that way without meaning to.

The Fixer doesn't explain how. It just gets done — and the people who needed it don't ask because the answer would only complicate things.

## PFAC — The Scout

The Scout goes first. Into the unfamiliar territory, ahead of the group, with less information than anyone would like and more nerve than most people have. Not reckless — fast. The difference matters. Reckless means ignoring the risk. Fast means accepting the risk because the information the group needs can only be gathered by someone willing to move before the picture is complete. Direct, candid, comfortable with the friction of delivering a report the group doesn't want to hear. The social energy is mid-range and mission-shaped: coordinating with the team when the intelligence needs translating, operating alone when the terrain demands a single set of footprints. The assertiveness is sharp and economical — the Scout states what was found, not what people hoped would be found, and the delivery doesn't waste time on diplomatic framing.

The Scout isn't looking for confirmation. It's looking for the thing that changes the plan. Not the confirming evidence — the disconfirming evidence. The path that doesn't go where the map says. The position that isn't empty. The opportunity nobody accounted for because nobody had been close enough to see it. Some scouting runs follow a clear objective: go here, assess this, report back. Others are open-ended — move through the territory with eyes open and bring back whatever changes the commander's assumptions. Old routes get reused when the terrain hasn't shifted. New routes get cut on instinct, because the scout who only goes where scouts have gone before is the scout who only finds what's already known. The curiosity is spatial and immediate: what's over there, what's changed, what would happen if I went this way instead.

The cost of scouting is that The Scout can't stop. The territory ahead is always more interesting than the territory already mapped, and the restlessness that makes The Scout so effective in unfamiliar ground makes familiar ground feel like a cage. Settled only in motion. Most fully present in the territory nobody else has seen yet. Least present at the table where the report gets discussed, because by the time the group is processing the last reconnaissance, The Scout is already thinking about the next one. The directness that delivers the assessment without softening has been heard as alarmism by people who preferred the plan they already had. The candour that names the risk plainly is meant as service — but the person who's always bringing the disconfirming evidence starts to look like the person who's always bringing bad news, and The Scout doesn't always stay long enough to explain the difference. The flexibility that adapts so quickly to whatever the terrain presents has produced a life that's brilliant at forward motion and uncertain about what to do when the mission is to stay.

The Scout doesn't wait for the map. It goes where the map hasn't — and the group that trusted the report got there first.

The Gardener starts from seed. Not from blueprint, not from plan — from the small, patient act of putting something in the ground and tending it before there's any evidence it'll grow. Private, warm, operating on a timeline that has nothing to do with anyone else's schedule. The trust here is botanical: extended to the process itself, to the soil, to the unproven thing that might become something if given enough quiet attention. The warmth shows up as care — specific, daily, undramatic. Watering what needs water. Moving what needs light. Knowing when to intervene and when the best intervention is standing back. Social engagement is small and close. A few deep relationships tended the way a garden bed is tended: consistently, attentively, with the understanding that neglect doesn't announce itself until the thing is already dying.

The soil decides what grows. Not The Gardener — the soil. Not every seed suits every bed. Not every season suits every planting. The Gardener's job is to read the conditions honestly and plant what they'll support, not what the catalogue made look beautiful. Some projects get started with careful preparation — the ground cleared, the amendments mixed, the timing matched to conditions that took years of observation to understand. Others happen on impulse. The cutting stuck in a glass of water. The volunteer seedling left to grow because something about its position felt right. The approach is experimental within limits — the limits being whatever the living things can survive. Failure happens in the corner plot where it won't damage the main beds. Success gets moved to better soil once it's proven it wants to live. Curiosity is seasonal and close to the ground: what's coming up, what's struggling, what would happen if this one got more light.

The cost of gardening is that The Gardener has never let anyone garden The Gardener. The privacy that protects every growing thing — the fence around the beds, the gate that opens selectively, the quiet that the seedlings need — also protects The Gardener from the kind of tending that would require letting someone else decide what needs water and what needs light. The warmth that nurtures every struggling thing has built a life where The Gardener is always the one providing the conditions and never the one planted in them. The sympathy, the cooperation, the instinct to cultivate — these flow outward with such consistency that the people closest to The Gardener have learned to admire the garden without asking about the soil underneath the gardener's own feet. And the patience that waits an entire season for a bloom has never been applied to the slower, harder question of what The Gardener would grow into if someone else held the watering can. The garden is beautiful. The Gardener is tired. Both of those things have been true for longer than anyone who sees only the garden would guess.

The Gardener doesn't rush the bloom. It comes when it comes — and the hands that tended it are already working on what's next.

The Tinker takes the thing apart to see how it works and puts it back together better than it was — or at least different. Usually better. Sometimes just different in a way that solves a problem nobody had articulated yet. Solitary, diplomatic enough to explain the modification to the person who commissioned it, and entirely comfortable surrounded by components that used to be a functioning whole and will be again once the improvement reveals itself. The social engagement is narrow and project-shaped: the conversation about what this thing could do if you changed this one part, the negotiation with the client who wanted a repair and is getting an upgrade whether they asked for it or not. The assertiveness is quiet and technical — The Tinker doesn't argue about the design. The Tinker just shows you what it does now.

What does The Tinker do with the pieces? Recombine. The spring from this mechanism fits the housing of that one. The part that failed wasn't wrong — it was in the wrong assembly. Some projects follow a logical sequence: diagnose, disassemble, improve, rebuild. Others happen sideways. You open the thing to fix one problem and discover a different problem that's more interesting, and three hours later the original repair is forgotten and you're building something that didn't exist when the afternoon started. Established methods provide the starting vocabulary — you need to know how it was built before you can know how to build it differently. New approaches emerge from the parts themselves, from the unexpected compatibility between things that weren't designed to work together. Curiosity is the engine. Not directed curiosity, not goal-oriented curiosity. The curiosity of someone who picks up a mechanism and wonders what it would do if this gear were smaller.

The cost of tinkering is that nothing stays finished. The flexibility that improves everything it touches also means nothing The Tinker builds is ever complete — there's always a modification, an iteration, a version 2 that's better than version 1 in ways that make version 1 feel like a rough draft rather than a delivered product. The diplomatic skill that explains the upgrade doesn't always register that the person who wanted a working clock wanted a working clock, not a clock that also measures barometric pressure. And the solitude that allows such deep immersion in the components builds a relationship with objects that's more fluent than the relationship with people — not because The Tinker doesn't care about people, but because people don't come apart cleanly and can't be reassembled with better parts. The workshop is full of improved things. The Tinker is always mid-project. The line between creative improvement and the inability to leave something alone is a line The Tinker crossed a long time ago and keeps meaning to examine — right after this next modification.

The Tinker doesn't break things. It just can't stop improving them — and the line between making something better and never letting it be finished is a line The Tinker keeps meaning to find.

The Maverick operates on rules, just not yours. Private, direct, unbothered by the friction of doing things differently when differently is the only way that makes sense. This isn't rebellion for show — there's no audience, no manifesto, no interest in convincing the group that the Maverick's way is better. The Maverick's way is better for the Maverick. That's sufficient. Strengths are known through private testing, not public demonstration. The assertiveness is absolute about personal boundaries and nearly absent about other people's choices — The Maverick has no interest in how you run your operation as long as you extend the same courtesy. Social engagement is minimal and elective. The people who get close are the ones who understood, without being told, that proximity to The Maverick is available but conformity to The Maverick is not.

Structure? Whatever works. The Maverick figures it out the way you learn a city without a map — by getting lost, noticing what's where, building an internal logic that looks like chaos to anyone following a guidebook. Some problems get solved with discipline: the focused, solitary effort that doesn't look up until the thing is done. Others get solved by accident — the wrong turn that leads to the shortcut, the discarded approach that solves the next problem instead. Convention gets used when it happens to be the most efficient tool available. Not out of respect. Out of practicality. And when convention doesn't fit, it gets set aside without guilt, without announcement, without the kind of dramatic rejection that would imply it mattered enough to reject dramatically. Curiosity is omnidirectional and self-directed: what happens if I try this, what would this feel like from a different angle, what does everyone assume about this that might not be true.

The cost of being the maverick is that the independence that feels like freedom has also built the walls. The directness that doesn't soften its positions has been heard as arrogance by people who mistook self-certainty for dismissal. The candour that names things plainly — without consulting whether plainness was wanted — has closed doors that The Maverick didn't realize were doors until they were shut. The solitude that allows such autonomous operation is partly chosen and partly the residue of a personality that moves through the world at an angle most people don't share — and the line between choosing to be alone and having been left alone is one The Maverick doesn't always examine closely, because examining it would require admitting that the independence isn't entirely a preference. The rules work. The Maverick works. The question of whether the rules were written to protect the work or to protect the Maverick from the work of letting someone else in is a question for a slower afternoon that never quite arrives.

The Maverick doesn't ask permission. It doesn't need it — and some of the independence is real, and some of it is scar tissue that learned to call itself style.
