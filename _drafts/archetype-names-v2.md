# Archetype Names v2 — Complete Library (81)

## Naming System

| Openness | Register | Rule |
|----------|----------|------|
| **O (Open-minded)** | Abstract, specialized, "WTF is that?" | Concepts from science, philosophy, or art. Names so specialized that high-O users feel elite and other types are intrigued. All names must be abstract. |
| **G (Grounded)** | Nature, forces, places | Landscape, celestial bodies, weather, geological formations. No animals. |
| **P (Practical)** | Jobs, tools, roles | Concrete, instantly understood. Zero-Google rule: every name must be clear without looking it up. |

### Encoding Axes

Each O-register uses the same three structural axes (C, E, A) but adapts the encoding to fit its vocabulary:

#### Shared across all groups

- **Conscientiousness (D/B/F):** Weight — D=heavy/enduring, B=steady/reliable, F=light/free
- **Extraversion (E/A/I):** Scale — E=public/expansive, A=team/community, I=solo/private

#### A-axis (Agreeableness) per register

| Register | W (Warm) | N (Negotiator) | C (Candid) |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **O-group** | Human/social field | Applied/philosophical field | Pure/material field |
| **G-group** | Warm temperature | Temperate | Cold temperature |
| **P-group** | Defined by who they serve | Defined by what they organize | Defined by what they hold to |

#### C-axis sub-categories (G-group)

| | E (Expansive) | A (Selective) | I (Contained) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GD (Heavy)** | Celestial | Earth formations | Deep earth |
| **GB (Steady)** | Seasons | Weather | Places |
| **GF (Airy)** | Cosmic | Hazardous weather | Fleeting phenomena |

#### C-axis sub-categories (O-group)

| | D (Disciplined) | B (Balanced) | F (Flexible) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain** | Science | Philosophy | Art |

### Reading the Matrices

- Top-left = warmest, most social, most public
- Bottom-right = sharpest, most solitary, most private
- Left column = human-oriented / warm / service-defined
- Right column = material-oriented / cold / principle-defined
- Top row = expansive / public-facing
- Bottom row = contained / solo
