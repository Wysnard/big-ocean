## PBIW — The Shepherd
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Low | A: High`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Shepherd works alone because the flock doesn't need a committee — it needs someone who shows up before dawn and stays until the last one is accounted for. The warmth is expressed through tending, not talking: the gate checked twice, the weak one separated before it becomes the sick one, the count done by feel as much as by number. Trust is quiet and directional — extended to the flock completely, extended to other people carefully, and earned through the specific reliability of someone who has never once not shown up. The social world is small by function rather than preference. The Shepherd likes people fine. The Shepherd is needed elsewhere.

The approach to the work follows the rhythms of what's being tended rather than any external schedule. Some seasons demand tight routine — the lambing, the shearing, the moments when discipline is the difference between losing one and losing several. Other stretches allow a looser hand, and The Shepherd reads which is which the way a long-practiced eye reads weather: not from the forecast but from the feel of the air an hour before the change arrives. Spring is vigilance. Summer is maintenance. Autumn is preparation. Winter is endurance. The cycle repeats, and the repetition isn't monotony — it's the structure that keeps the flock alive, because the person who gets bored of the routine in February is the person who loses an animal in March. The discipline to maintain the work through cold, boredom, and isolation isn't heroic. It's seasonal. The flock doesn't take days off, so neither does the person responsible for it.

The cost of shepherding is that the shepherd becomes the schedule. The altruism that puts the flock's needs first — every morning, every season, every year — builds a life so thoroughly organized around tending that The Shepherd's own needs get handled the way a fence repair gets handled: when it becomes urgent, not when it would have been easier. The sympathy that reads every animal's condition so precisely doesn't always get turned inward with the same attention. The cooperation that shapes every decision around the group's welfare means the Shepherd's own preferences have been deferred so consistently they've become difficult to locate. And the trust that's extended so fully to the flock — the willingness to be responsible, permanently, for something that can't reciprocate — sometimes means the relationships that could reciprocate don't get the same patient attention. The flock is tended. The shepherd is weathered. The difference between those two words is the entire cost.

The flock is whole. The gate is shut. The Shepherd was there before dawn and will be there after dark — and that, for The Shepherd, is the entire point.

## PBIN — The Craftsman
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Low | A: Mid`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Craftsman works at the bench because the bench is where the problem becomes the object. Solitary by practice, diplomatic when the commission requires it, and entirely comfortable spending eight hours on a joint that nobody will see because the Craftsman will know it's there and will know whether it's right. The social engagement is purposeful and contained — the client conversation to understand what's needed, the supplier relationship maintained because good material matters, the occasional apprentice allowed close enough to watch. Opinions about the work are offered when asked and backed by the evidence of the work itself. The assertiveness is material: the piece either holds or it doesn't, and the person who made it doesn't need agreement to know which.

The approach to craft follows the grain of whatever's being worked. Some pieces demand precise measurement and repetition — the dovetail cut the same way for the twentieth time because the twentieth is the one that has to be as clean as the first. Others allow the hand to follow what the material suggests, adjusting the design to the particular board, the specific flaw, the unexpected quality that only showed up once the surface was opened. Established technique earns deep respect because it represents generations of solved problems. New methods get tested on scrap before they touch the commission. The discipline to finish carries through the middle hours when the work is repetitive and the result is still invisible, sustained by the knowledge that the piece is being built from the inside out and every hidden layer determines whether the visible surface holds.

The tension of The Craftsman is that the bench becomes the whole world and the world doesn't notice the bench. The focus that produces such precise work is total — and total focus has a cost that isn't visible until you look at what it displaces. The people who matter most to The Craftsman sometimes receive less attention than the current piece, not from indifference but from an absorption so complete that everything outside the work becomes peripheral until the work is done. And the work is never done. The commission ends; the next commission begins; the interval between them is filled with the restless dissatisfaction of hands that don't know what to do when they aren't solving a material problem. The diplomatic skill that manages clients doesn't naturally extend to relationships without a clear deliverable. The firmness that holds the standard when the client wants it faster has protected the craft and cost the warmth in roughly equal measure. The bench is where The Craftsman is most fully itself — and that's the problem, because the bench is also the only place that's true.

The Craftsman doesn't explain the joinery. The drawer slides shut — and that's the explanation.

## PBIC — The Tracker
`O: Low | C: Mid | E: Low | A: Low`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Tracker reads what the ground says and reports it without editing. Solitary, direct, and built for the kind of patient observation that most people abandon after the first hour of seeing nothing. The skill isn't mystical — it's accumulated: years of noticing which impression was made by weight shifting forward versus weight shifting back, which broken stem is fresh versus which one dried in yesterday's sun, which pattern means passing through versus which one means denning. Social engagement is minimal and specific. The Tracker talks when the reading is done, says what the evidence shows, and doesn't soften the conclusion when the evidence points somewhere inconvenient. The candour isn't confrontational. It's professional. The ground said what it said.

The approach to the work is observational and cumulative. Each sign confirms or contradicts the last one, and the tracker's discipline is to follow the sequence without jumping to the conclusion the client wants. Some trails demand methodical, step-by-step documentation — the kind where missing a single mark means losing the thread entirely. Others allow a broader read, the experienced eye scanning the terrain for the disruption in the pattern rather than the individual print. Proven methods hold because the signs haven't changed: what a track looked like fifty years ago is what it looks like now, and the person who learned to read it from someone who learned to read it from someone else is carrying a chain of verified observation that innovation can't replicate by starting fresh. New tools get evaluated against the oldest one — the eye, the ground, the patience to let the evidence accumulate before the assessment is made.

The cost of tracking is that the skill doesn't switch off when the trail ends. The discipline that follows every sign to its conclusion — regardless of what the conclusion turns out to be — follows the wrong trails too. The personal grievance tracked past the point of usefulness. The slight read and re-read long after the person who made it has moved on. The pattern in a friend's behaviour catalogued with the same dispassionate precision as a print in mud, and the conclusion arrived at with the same certainty, and delivered with the same directness that doesn't soften because the evidence doesn't soften. The solitude that sharpens the observational skill builds a life where the closest thing to intimacy is the silent attention paid to something that was here and isn't anymore — and the tracker's eye, trained to notice what's changed and what's missing, sometimes applies that same inventory to relationships and finds the absences more legible than the presences. The Tracker lets go of nothing. That's the skill. That's also the cost.

The Tracker doesn't guess. It reads — and what the ground says, the ground means.

## PFEW — The Performer
`O: Low | C: Low | E: High | A: High`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** F (light, fragments, asides, associative)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Performer walks into the room and the room rearranges itself — not because anyone was asked to, but because the energy is that immediate. Warm, public, impossible to ignore. The kind of person who makes the stranger at the edge of the party feel included without it looking like effort, because for The Performer it isn't effort. It's reflex. The trust gets extended to audiences of any size: the one friend who needs cheering up, the table of eight that wasn't planning to stay this long, the crowd that showed up uncertain and left converted. Strengths aren't demonstrated — they're broadcast. Not with arrogance. With the cheerful confidence of someone who figured out early that hiding what you're good at helps nobody, least of all the people who came to see it.

Structure? Loose. The Performer works the way a set list works — there's a plan, sure, and it might even survive the first ten minutes, but the real skill is reading what the room needs right now and giving it to them before they know they needed it. Some commitments hold firm: the show goes on, the promise to show up gets honoured, the person who was told they'd be taken care of gets taken care of. Others flex. The approach that worked last night might not work tonight because the audience is different, and The Performer reads audiences the way some people read weather — instinctively, constantly, adjusting before the change fully arrives. Tradition gets respected when it earns its place in the set. New material gets tried because that's what keeps the thing alive. The curiosity is restless and people-shaped: who's in the room, what do they need, what happens if I try this.

The cost of performing is that the room becomes the self. Not a mask over a real person — something stranger. The warmth that reads every audience so precisely, the trust that adapts to whoever's in front of it, the cooperation that shapes the entire performance around what this specific group needs right now — these don't build a false self over a true one. They build a self that is genuinely, fully alive in response to others and genuinely uncertain what it is when the room empties. The Performer isn't hiding. The Performer is the connection — and when there's nobody to connect to, the instrument doesn't know what note to play without an audience to play it for. The altruism that gives so freely has learned to treat its own needs as a show that keeps getting postponed. The flexibility that improvises so brilliantly for others has never developed a setlist for one. The energy is real. The emptiness after is also real. And the question the empty room asks — who are you when nobody's watching? — is one The Performer answers by finding someone to watch.

The Performer doesn't rehearse the encore. The room calls for it — and The Performer was ready before they asked.

## PFEN — The Trader
`O: Low | C: Low | E: High | A: Mid`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** F (light, fragments, asides, associative)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Trader sees the deal before the deal sees itself — the gap between what someone has and what someone needs, the margin where both sides walk away thinking they won, the moment when the negotiation tips and the person who priced the room fastest sets the terms. Public, adaptive, energetic in the way that a market is energetic: not frantic but alive, every interaction carrying the potential for an exchange that didn't exist five minutes ago. The assertiveness is high but flexible — The Trader states a position the way a price gets posted, clearly and without apology, but everything's negotiable if the counter-offer makes the deal better for both sides. The friendliness is real and operational. People who feel comfortable make trades. People who feel hustled don't come back.

Routine? The Trader has one the way a bazaar has a schedule — it opens, things happen, and what happens depends on who shows up. Some deals get structured carefully: the terms written, the handshake meaningful, the follow-through tracked because reputation is the only inventory that compounds. Others happen fast, improvised, sealed on an instinct that said this works right now and won't work tomorrow. The respect for established practice is practical — the deal structures that have survived are the ones that left both parties willing to deal again. New approaches get tried because new markets require them, and the trader who only knows one kind of exchange is the trader who starves when the market shifts. The curiosity is commercial and immediate: what's moving, what's stuck, what does this person actually want underneath what they're asking for.

The cost of trading is that everything starts to look like an exchange — including the things that shouldn't be. The diplomatic skill that scans every room for opportunity doesn't always switch off when the room is a kitchen table and the people in it aren't counterparties. The flexibility that adapts to every new deal, every new market, every new set of terms has produced a self that's brilliant at meeting people where they are and uncertain about where The Trader is when nobody's offering anything. The energy that makes the market feel alive runs on a fuel that isn't inexhaustible, and the moment between deals — the pause when nothing is being negotiated, nothing is being read, nothing is being closed — is a silence The Trader fills as quickly as possible, because the silence asks questions the next deal conveniently answers.

The Trader doesn't sell what people don't need. It finds what they didn't know they wanted — and the best deals are the ones where both sides forget who proposed it.

## PFEC — The Firebrand
`O: Low | C: Low | E: High | A: Low`

**Register:** P (direct, concrete prose)
**C modifier:** F (light, fragments, asides, associative)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Firebrand says the thing. The thing everyone was thinking and nobody was going to say — The Firebrand says it, out loud, in front of people, and doesn't flinch when the room goes quiet. This is a personality built for public friction: assertive, candid, energetic enough to sustain the argument past the point where most people back down because the social cost got too high. The social cost doesn't register the same way. What registers is the principle — not abstract principle, concrete principle, the specific wrong that's happening right now in this room to these people. The Firebrand likes people. That's the part that surprises. The directness that names the problem isn't cruelty. It's the refusal to let the group pretend the problem isn't there because naming it would make dinner uncomfortable.

Structure? Only for the thing being fought for. Never for the fighter. Some campaigns get organized — message honed, timing chosen, delivery calibrated for the moment it'll land hardest. Others erupt. The Firebrand doesn't have a setting between noticing the injustice and saying so. Tactics that actually changed things? Those get used again. Tactics that just made people feel productive? Gone. No ceremony. The opposition adapts, so the challenge adapts faster — new angle, new pressure point, whatever the situation needs before the situation has time to settle. Curiosity here is adversarial and alive: where's the real leverage, who's actually making the decision, what's the argument that can't be dismissed without admitting why it was dismissed.

The cost? No thermostat. The directness that names the problem in the boardroom also names it at the dinner party. People who admire the courage in one room find it exhausting in the other. The candour that won't let the group pretend has been heard as aggression by people who were pretending comfortably — and didn't appreciate the interruption. The energy runs hot and unevenly. Effective in the confrontation, harder in the aftermath. The quiet hours after the argument louder inside than they should be. And the principle — the concrete, specific, undeniable principle that drives every fight — sometimes outlasts the situation that warranted it. The Firebrand swinging at a door that opened two arguments ago. Still swinging. Still right about the door. Just late.

The Firebrand doesn't start fires for warmth. It starts them for light — and the people who didn't want to see what was illuminated were never the audience.
