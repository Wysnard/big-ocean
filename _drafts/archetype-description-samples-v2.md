# Archetype Description Samples — Voice Test (Final)

Three samples testing the O-level voice system. Each preserves clinical meaning, uses third person, and adapts prose style to the Openness register.

## Style Guide (locked v2)

**North star:** Self-recognition. Every sentence must make the reader feel *known*. Impact over stylistic concerns.

### Core Rules

- **Third person** throughout ("they" not "you")
- **All groups open with a felt moment** — the difference is how long the poetry lasts
- **E+A leads paragraph 1** — the reader meets the personality (how they meet the world), then discovers the cognitive style (O+C)
- **Facet-aware** — each trait at its level must touch 3-4 of its 6 facets across the description, spread across flavors so no single facet dominates
- **1500-2500 characters** — enforce with actual count before finalizing

### Four-Paragraph Emotional Arc

1. **The Hook** — "How do you know that about me?"
2. **The Deepening** — "You understand how I am with people"
3. **The Surprise** — "I never thought of it that way, but... yes" — must include one honest **cost or tension** of this personality combination. Not a weakness, but the price of the gift. Something the reader already knows about themselves but hasn't seen articulated. (e.g., "The silence after saying something true that landed harder than intended." "The trail of brilliant starts that never quite became finishes.")
4. **The Gift** — A closing line that rings like a bell. Every archetype must have a last line someone wants on a wall.

### Shadow Rule

Every description must acknowledge **one real friction point** — the moment where this combination creates a cost the person recognizes. For A-Low: not "respects you enough for truth" but the moment they realize the truth landed harder than they meant. For E-Low: not just "recharges in solitude" but the invitation they declined that they sometimes wonder about. This is what separates honest portraits from horoscopes.

### Voice Registers

| | **P** | **G** | **O** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening image | One sentence, in and out | Short scene, 2-3 sentences | Never leaves — metaphor is the medium |
| Body metaphors | Zero (except bookend open/close) | One per paragraph, any domain | Woven throughout |
| Closing | One strong bookend image | Resonant landing with imagery | Poetic resolution |
| Sentences | Short, direct | Medium, natural rhythm | Long, layered |
| D modifier | Tight, logical | Tight, logical | Tight, logical |
| B modifier | Natural flow | Natural flow | Natural flow |
| F modifier | Conversational | Associative | Dreamlike |
| Clinical language | Acceptable sparingly | Avoid | Avoid |
| Goal | "I do exactly that" | "That's who I am" | "That's what I feel" |

### Metaphor Rule

Metaphors within a description should **relate to the archetype's name and semantic world**. The Cadenza's metaphors should draw from music. The Bonfire's from fire and gathering. The Captain's from ships and leadership. This reinforces the name as a felt identity, not just a label.

### Repetition Rules

- **Across archetypes:** Acceptable. Nobody reads all 81. Same structural patterns are fine.
- **Within one archetype:** Zero tolerance. No phrase, image, or insight should appear twice in the same description.
- **Banned crutch for E-Mid:** The "lively evening with friends / quiet night alone" construction is banned. Show ambiversion through specific behavioral variety — leading the meeting one hour, happy to let someone else lead the next; the friend who organizes the dinner but slips out early without guilt.
- **A-Mid specificity:** Don't just say "reads the room." Show the *switch point* — the specific moment this person moves from accommodating to firm, which differs by E and C combination.

### Adventurousness in Introverts

Do not always "turn adventurousness inward." Some introverted high-O people genuinely travel, take physical risks, or seek novel sensory experiences. Acknowledge multiple forms of adventurousness across introverted descriptions.

## The Captain — PDEW (Practical + Disciplined + Extravert + Warm)

**Register:** P (direct, concrete, bookend metaphors only)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical progression)

Some people walk into a room and the room rearranges itself — not out of fear, not out of obligation, but because something in The Captain's presence says *this is going to work out, and here's how.* That kind of trust isn't claimed. It's built through a hundred kept promises and a thousand small follow-throughs that nobody else was tracking. Proven methods come first here. Not out of fear of the new, but because what works deserves respect, and what's untested has to earn its place. Plans have structure, timelines hold, and people know exactly what's expected. That clarity isn't rigid. It's generous.

There's a particular kind of social gravity at work in this personality. Not dominance — presence. The Captain doesn't talk over people; they draw people in. The invitation to contribute is always real. They remember who said what last meeting. They follow up. Friends and colleagues build a specific kind of reliance on this — not the desperate kind, but the steady kind, the kind where you stop worrying because you know someone competent and warm has it handled.

Here's what most people miss about The Captain, sometimes including The Captain themselves: the discipline isn't the engine. The warmth is. Every structured plan, every followed-through commitment, every clear expectation set — these aren't expressions of control. They're expressions of care wearing work clothes. Helping someone doesn't look like a heart-to-heart. It looks like restructuring their workload before they had to ask. When The Captain says "you can handle this," people believe it — not because of authority, but because The Captain has never once said it without meaning it.

The Captain builds things that outlast the applause — and never needed the applause to begin with.

## The Horizon — GBAN (Grounded + Balanced + Ambivert + Negotiator)

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor, any domain)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)

There's a steadiness in how The Horizon moves through life that most people feel before they can name it. Not loud, not withdrawn — just present, in a way that makes the room feel slightly more settled. Opinions form carefully here, tested against multiple angles before they're offered, and when they do arrive they carry the kind of weight that comes from having genuinely considered what it would feel like to be wrong. That balance isn't performed. It's constitutional — as natural as gravity, and about as negotiable.

Social energy flows in both directions without friction. A lively dinner with friends one evening, a quiet night alone the next — neither feels like a compromise or a recovery from the other. The Horizon reads a room the way a good musician reads an audience, adjusting without making a show of it. Conversations tend to deepen around this personality because people sense they won't be judged for what they say, and that quiet permission is rarer than most realize. It doesn't announce itself. It just creates space, and people step into it.

What's easy to miss — and what The Horizon may not fully see from the inside — is that this adaptability isn't neutrality. It looks moderate from the outside, but underneath there is a very specific point of view, arrived at through genuine deliberation. A crisis needs calm? Calm arrives. A celebration needs energy? Energy shows up. But none of it is performance. The Horizon doesn't shapeshift to please — they respond to what's actually needed, and there's an enormous difference between the two that only the people closest to them ever fully understand.

Some people find their center by pushing against the world. The Horizon finds it by standing still long enough to see clearly — and then offering that clarity, quietly, to anyone wise enough to ask.

## The Singularity — OFIC (Open + Flexible + Introvert + Candid)

**Register:** O (lyrical, metaphor-rich, layered sentences)
**C modifier:** F (dreamlike, stream-of-consciousness)

Something burns at the center of The Singularity that has never needed oxygen from the outside world — a creative fire so self-sustaining that solitude doesn't diminish it but concentrates it, the way pressure turns carbon into something that cuts through everything it touches. There is no schedule to this burning, no blueprint it follows, no institution that could contain it without losing the very thing that makes it valuable. Ideas arrive on their own time, unannounced, and the freedom to receive them without negotiation or compromise is not a preference but a condition of existence — the non-negotiable terms of a treaty signed long ago between this personality and its own nature.

The world outside the inner life exists, is noted, is occasionally engaged — but always on terms that protect the essential flame. Social convention holds no particular authority here, not out of contempt but out of a fundamental disinterest in performing what isn't felt. Conversation, when it happens, cuts straight to the marrow or doesn't happen at all. There is no small talk in The Singularity's vocabulary, not because they're incapable of it but because every hour spent on surface exchange is an hour stolen from the deep work that actually matters, and the accounting of that loss is precise and unforgiving.

Here is the secret The Singularity rarely tells anyone, perhaps because they've never found the right words for it, or perhaps because the right audience has never appeared: the independence isn't armor. It's architecture. The solitude isn't withdrawal from a world that disappointed them — it's the construction of an inner world so vast, so intricate, so alive with possibility that the outer world simply cannot compete. What looks like rejection is actually fidelity — a fierce, unbreakable loyalty to the one thing that has never lied to them: the work itself.

The Singularity does not orbit anything. Everything else, eventually, orbits it.
