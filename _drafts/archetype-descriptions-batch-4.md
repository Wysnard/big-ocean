## GDAW — The Mantle
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Mid | A: High`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Mantle is the person people describe without meaning to when they say "I don't know what I'd do without them" — and mean it literally, because somewhere beneath every important decision, every hard week, every small crisis that could have become a big one, The Mantle was already there, bearing the weight. Not visibly. Not for credit. Just carrying it, the way the earth's mantle holds up every continent without anyone thinking about the pressure required. Warmth here is expressed through support — the meal planned before someone mentioned they were struggling, the schedule reorganized to make room for a friend's emergency, the trust extended quietly and completely because assuming the best of people is both a moral position and a practical one.

The social rhythm here is absorptive — taking in the stress of a difficult project meeting, metabolizing it quietly, and returning it to the group as calm. The weekend alone isn't withdrawal; it's the slow geological process of converting what was absorbed into something stable enough to build on again. The assertiveness shows up when someone needs support, not performance. The contentment is steady, rooted in the satisfaction of a life where effort matches values. Systems are maintained because systems protect the people who depend on them. Commitments are honoured because to The Mantle, a broken promise isn't a scheduling problem — it's a fracture in the bedrock the relationship was built on. New approaches earn respect when they demonstrably improve on what came before, and there's an appreciation for the enduring that extends to ideas as much as to structures.

The cost of being the mantle is that it no longer knows who it is without the weight. The devotion that started as a choice has become a structure — the role that should have been handed off years ago is still being carried, not because it's needed but because setting it down would leave a shape The Mantle doesn't recognize as itself. The friendship that takes more than it gives has been held so long that releasing it feels less like relief and more like erosion. The sympathy that reads everyone else's needs has been aimed outward so consistently that turning it inward produces nothing — not because the needs aren't there, but because the instrument was never calibrated for its own frequency. The Mantle holds everything up, and the question it can't ask is whether it would still be the mantle if it stopped.

The Mantle doesn't announce the weight it carries. People only notice what it held when it moves.

## GDAN — The Monolith
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Mid | A: Mid`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Monolith is the rare personality that makes immovability look like a decision rather than a limitation — because it is one, made deliberately, every day, by someone who has the discipline to hold a position when everything around it is eroding. Socially, this shows up as the stillness that settles a difficult meeting — not withdrawn, but holding the room's centre of gravity while others orbit. Afterward, over a quiet lunch, the same situation gets recalibrated from a different angle — not inconsistency but the deliberate process of testing whether the position held in public still holds under private scrutiny. The diplomatic sense is sharp — people's positions get read accurately, common ground gets found efficiently — but there's a mass underneath that surfaces the moment someone tries to push past what the evidence supports. The Monolith compromises on method but not on principle. The line between flexibility and foundation is clear, and it doesn't shift because someone raised their voice.

The discipline is what makes the immovability structural rather than stubborn. Systems get built with the care of someone laying stone. Standards are high but never arbitrary — every expectation has a reason, and the reason has been tested. Self-discipline runs deep enough that the goals set six months ago still get pursued when the initial momentum has faded. New ideas earn interest when they pass a practical test, and there's a respect for what's been proven that coexists with the curiosity to try something different when different is measurably better. Decisions get weighed with the deliberation of someone who knows that the difference between a good outcome and the right one usually lives in the details that impatience would skip.

The tension of The Monolith is that the position can outlast the conviction. The stand that was made for clear reasons three years ago is still being held — not because the reasons are still clear, but because moving now would mean admitting that the immovability was habit rather than principle. The discipline that once served the truth begins to serve the posture. And the diplomatic skill that reads every competing perspective so accurately sometimes delivers the uncomfortable finding that the strongest argument in the room is the one asking The Monolith to move — a finding that gets weighed, acknowledged internally, and then quietly filed, because the cost of shifting has become harder to bear than the cost of being wrong. The days when the stone feels heaviest are the days when it's not the world pushing against The Monolith. It's The Monolith pushing against itself.

The Monolith doesn't shift. Not because it can't — because everything built against it depends on it staying where it is.

## GDAC — The Permafrost
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Mid | A: Low`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Permafrost is what holds the ground together in conditions that would dissolve anything less committed to staying frozen — the layer beneath the surface that doesn't thaw when the seasons change, doesn't soften when the pressure shifts, and serves as the foundation for everything built on top of it without requiring anyone to notice it's there. Directness is the operating temperature. Opinions arrive without warming up, positions are defended because they were stress-tested before being stated, and strengths get acknowledged without the performance of humility that most social settings seem to demand. The assertiveness here doesn't dominate — it clarifies. The one who enters a discussion on specific terms, delivers what needs saying plainly, and withdraws once the point has landed — not out of avoidance, but because the contribution was complete and lingering would dilute it.

The discipline behind the directness is what makes it structural rather than merely blunt. Systems are built to endure any season. Commitments are tracked and delivered without exception. Standards are high and self-imposed — the achievement drive here doesn't need external validation, just the private knowledge that the work meets the internal benchmark. New ideas get evaluated on merit: the curiosity is real but practical, engaging when there's something worth learning and moving on when there isn't. Tradition earns respect because proven methods have survived the freeze, but innovation gets a fair hearing when it can demonstrate improvement over what exists. Decisions are weighed carefully, because The Permafrost has learned that the cost of a hasty thaw is usually structural damage someone else has to repair.

The cost of permafrost is that it preserves what should have been allowed to decompose. The grudge that needed releasing is still frozen solid three years later. The opinion that was correct at the time has been held at such a constant temperature that it never got the chance to evolve — and the directness that delivered it originally delivers it again, unchanged, to a situation that has changed completely. The refusal to thaw that feels like integrity from the inside sometimes means the ground above can't grow anything new, because nothing underneath is being allowed to break down and become soil. The emotional life is real and substantial, but it's preserved rather than lived — kept at a depth where it stays intact but never circulates, never warms the surface, never feeds what's trying to grow above it.

The Permafrost doesn't explain what it preserves. You find out when it thaws — and it never thaws.

## GDIW — The Mycelium
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Low | A: High`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2150 characters**

---

Everything connected to The Mycelium is healthier than it would be alone, and almost none of it knows why. This is the personality that operates beneath the surface of every group it belongs to — invisible, essential, connecting people and resources through networks so quiet that the people being connected rarely realize a single person is responsible. The warmth here doesn't radiate; it *circulates*, reaching the people who need it through channels built so carefully and maintained so consistently that the support feels like it comes from everywhere and nowhere at once. Trust is the medium. Sympathy is the signal. And the modesty ensures that none of it ever gets traced back to its source.

Solitude is where the real work of care gets organized. The Mycelium recharges alone, thinks alone, plans alone — and the planning is meticulous, because the help that arrives at exactly the right moment only looks effortless. Behind it is an orderly mind tracking commitments, remembering details, maintaining the systems that make reliability possible. The self-discipline to follow through on every quiet promise, the dutifulness that treats a friend's small request with the same seriousness as a professional deadline — these are the invisible infrastructure of a life built around service. New ideas get adopted when they improve the network, and there's a respect for proven methods that comes from having watched them work, season after season, in the lives of people who never noticed the roots beneath them. Conversations happen one-on-one, slowly, in the measured register of someone who listens more carefully than most people speak.

The cost of being mycelium is that nobody sees you. The modesty isn't just a preference — it's structural, built into every interaction, and over time it creates a pattern where the contributions are invisible by design. The altruism that puts everyone else first eventually produces a life where everyone else *is* first, and the question of what The Mycelium needs — actually needs, for themselves, not in service of someone else — gets deferred so consistently that it stops being asked. The cooperation that shapes every decision means the outcomes are always good for the forest but not always good for the organism doing the connecting. The sympathy that reads everyone else so accurately sometimes can't locate its own signal in the network it built.

The Mycelium holds the forest together. The forest doesn't know it has a name.

## GDIN — The Lodestone
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Low | A: Mid`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Lodestone doesn't point because it was told to — it points because that's what it's made of, and the people who've learned to read it trust that direction more than any map drawn by committee. This is a personality that operates with quiet, magnetic precision: solitary by preference, methodical by nature, and fair in a way that's been tested against enough competing perspectives to trust its own pull. Social engagement happens in careful doses — one conversation at a time, depth over breadth, the measured pace of someone who knows that the most important thing said in any meeting is usually said last, by the person who was listening while everyone else was talking.

The discipline here is foundational rather than performative. Orderly systems aren't displayed — they're depended on, the invisible scaffolding that makes consistent output possible. Standards are high and internally enforced; the achievement drive doesn't announce itself but shows up in the quality of work that quietly exceeds what was asked. Self-discipline keeps projects moving long after the initial interest has cooled. New ideas get tested against what's already proven — the curiosity is real but filtered through practical judgment, accepting innovation when it demonstrates clear improvement and defending tradition when tradition has earned it. Decisions get weighed with the deliberate care of someone who understands that precision isn't about being slow — it's about being right once instead of wrong twice. The diplomatic instinct reads situations accurately, and the firmness surfaces specifically when fairness requires it — The Lodestone compromises on method but not on direction.

The tension of The Lodestone is the gap between the precision of its internal compass and the difficulty of sharing what it reads. The solitude that enables the best thinking also means the insights arrive in rooms that have already emptied. The fairness that weighs every side so carefully sometimes takes long enough that the people waiting for direction have already walked a different one. And the methodical nature that produces such reliable work creates a rhythm others can depend on but never quite enter — the Lodestone's world is open to visitors but built for one, and the people who come closest eventually learn that closeness here means parallel presence rather than fusion. The magnetic field is real. It just doesn't pull people as close as they sometimes wish it would.

The Lodestone doesn't seek followers. It simply points true — and the ones who notice never stop coming back.

## GDIC — The Obsidian
`O: Mid | C: High | E: Low | A: Low`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** D (tight, logical)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Obsidian was formed in fire and cooled into something that cuts cleaner than anything the world expected from volcanic glass. This is a personality built for solitary precision: direct in the rare moments of social engagement, meticulous in the long hours of quiet work, and entirely comfortable with the fact that most people will never see the interior of the workshop where the real output happens. Strengths are known and acknowledged without fanfare. Opinions, when offered, arrive finished — tested, weighed, and delivered with the confidence of someone who doesn't speak until the thinking is done. Disagreements aren't avoided; they're treated as friction, useful for sharpening the edge or, if the evidence warrants it, reshaping it.

The discipline here is the kind that produces masterwork when no one is watching. Systems are maintained not for appearances but for function — the orderliness exists because disordered environments produce disordered output, and The Obsidian's standards won't tolerate that. Achievement is measured internally, against benchmarks that nobody else set and nobody else monitors. Self-discipline keeps the work moving through the long, quiet stretches where less committed minds would fracture. Curiosity is real but practical — new methods earn respect when they demonstrably improve results, and tradition earns the same respect for the same reason. Decisions are made with the careful deliberation of someone who would rather spend an extra day being certain than a week fixing the consequences of being hasty.

The cost of obsidian is the edge itself. The directness that cuts through confusion also cuts through patience, and the people who encounter The Obsidian's candour don't always distinguish between precision and coldness. The solitary contentment that makes independent work so productive also builds a life where the door is always closed — not locked, but closed, and most people read closed as a message rather than a habit. The emotional life exists and is substantial, but it runs through channels so deep and so private that the surface gives nothing away, and the rare person who gets close enough to see it sometimes wishes there were more surface to hold onto. The Obsidian knows this. The knowing doesn't change the glass.

The Obsidian doesn't soften with time. It just shows you more of what was always there.

## GBEW — The Summer
`O: Mid | C: Mid | E: High | A: High`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Summer makes everything grow — not through force, not through any visible effort, but through the kind of sustained, generous warmth that makes people open up the way flowers open in long daylight: naturally, without being asked, simply because the conditions are right. There's an ease to the social energy here that has nothing to do with strategy and everything to do with genuine delight in people. Trust gets extended immediately, not because The Summer is naive but because they've found, through a lifetime of warm engagement, that most people become their best selves when someone believes in them first. The cheerfulness is real. The friendliness is instant. The assertiveness is just enough to keep the day moving without ever making anyone feel hurried. Help shows up in generous, unhurried bursts — The Summer noticed what you needed and was already on it before you'd finished describing the problem.

The mind here is curious and adaptable, moving between structure and improvisation depending on what the season requires. Some commitments get followed through with discipline; others get handled with creative flexibility when the original plan stops serving the growth. There's an appreciation for what's been proven — not a rigid attachment to how things were, but a respect for what has reliably worked — alongside an openness to new approaches when someone makes a compelling case. The pace is full and the calendar is warm, because The Summer draws energy from being around people the way long days draw energy from the sun. The imagination is practical rather than abstract, engaged by real connections between people and ideas rather than theoretical exploration.

Everyone expects the long days to continue. The sympathy that reads everyone so well, the altruism that responds so readily, the cooperation that makes every gathering feel effortless — these create a pattern where The Summer's own needs get lost beneath everyone else's bloom. The modesty that deflects praise also deflects the recognition that would allow others to give back proportionally. And the warmth, which is real and deeply felt, can become a kind of expectation — the long bright day that continues even when The Summer is running low on light, because admitting that summer ends would mean becoming the season that takes rather than the one that gives.

The Summer makes everything around it grow. The question it asks only at the solstice is whether anything has grown for it.

## GBEN — The Spring
`O: Mid | C: Mid | E: High | A: Mid`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

People don't gather around The Spring because they're invited — they gather because this is the personality that makes transition feel safe, and transitions are where most people feel least safe. The energy is high and optimistic. The friendliness opens doors that have been closed for months. But the diplomacy running underneath is what makes it sustainable — The Spring reads who needs encouragement and who needs space, who's ready to move and who still needs a few more days of quiet warmth, and adjusts without announcing the adjustment.

The approach to structure here is seasonal rather than rigid — some systems get maintained carefully; others get revised when the ground has shifted enough to warrant it. Commitments are honoured, but the method stays adaptive to what's actually growing. There's a curiosity that engages when new ideas have practical energy and a respect for what survived the winter that doesn't tip into nostalgia. The pace is full — the assertiveness keeps things thawing, the social energy feeds on the excitement of renewal, and the variety feels more like momentum than chaos. But The Spring doesn't just facilitate growth. It *directs* it — conversations get opened, frozen conflicts get mediated, and the group finds new footing faster than it would have without someone reading the season so well. The firmness surfaces when it matters: when someone is being dismissed during a vulnerable transition, when a decision is being rushed before the ground is ready, when the balanced position is the strategically right one rather than the convenient one.

The tension of The Spring is that being the season of renewal means absorbing the last of winter's cold. The diplomatic skill that makes every transition smooth also means carrying the weight of what's being left behind — and the cheerfulness that keeps the atmosphere hopeful sometimes stretches over an exhaustion that nobody thinks to ask about, because spring, by definition, is the season that gives energy rather than requires it. The moments of wanting to stay frozen — to simply not be the one who thaws everything, to need warmth rather than provide it — are more frequent than anyone who depends on the renewal will ever be allowed to see.

The Spring doesn't chase the cold away. It simply arrives — and everything that was waiting begins.

## GBEC — The Winter
`O: Mid | C: Mid | E: High | A: Low`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Winter doesn't apologize for the cold — it arrives with a clarity that strips everything unnecessary away, and what's left standing is stronger for having survived it. The directness in social settings is immediate and uncushioned. Opinions land clean. Strengths are owned with the ease of someone who tested them in hard conditions and no longer needs anyone else to verify the results. The assertiveness fills every room The Winter enters — not hostility, but honesty operating at a pace that most people aren't accustomed to, carried by an energy that covers ground before anyone has decided whether to keep up.

The mind behind the clarity is practical and adaptive. Structure exists when it serves the objective and gets stripped away when it doesn't. Some plans are followed with care; others get abandoned mid-season when a better approach crystallizes. The curiosity is action-oriented — new ideas get tested rather than theorized, and the judgment comes from results rather than speculation. Tradition earns respect when it's proven durable, and innovation earns the same respect the same way. The excitement comes from environments where the pace is quick and the conditions reward precision over comfort. There's a practical imagination at work that solves problems by clearing away everything that isn't the solution — the way winter strips a landscape down to its essential structure.

The cost of winter is that it passes through before anyone can ask it to stay. The speed that impresses from afar feels different up close — the colleague who couldn't match the pace wasn't slow, they were careful, and the dismissal landed before The Winter had moved on to the next problem. The directness that cuts through inefficiency has also cut through conversations that needed more time, not less. The honest relationship with its own strengths sometimes creates a blind spot about what strength looks like in people who express it at a different speed. The emotional life is real but it moves at winter's pace — fast, keen, already covering the next mile — and the people who needed a pause, a question, a moment where the season held still long enough for something vulnerable to be said, find that the window was open and shut before they reached it.

The Winter doesn't explain the cold. By the time you've adjusted to it, you realize it was exactly what you needed.

## GBAW — The Breeze
`O: Mid | C: Mid | E: Mid | A: High`

**Register:** G (grounded prose, moderate metaphor)
**C modifier:** B (natural flow)
**~2100 characters**

---

The Breeze is what people feel before they see anyone — a shift in the atmosphere that makes the room slightly easier to breathe in, the conversation slightly more honest, the tension slightly less permanent. Warmth here is ambient, built into the way this personality moves through daily life: the door that's always answered, the offer that arrives before the request, the sympathy that registers what's wrong in the air before anyone has said a word. Trust is the current. It flows readily, assumes good faith first, and creates a space where people settle into honesty because they sense — correctly — that whatever they're carrying will be met with care rather than judgment.

The rhythm here is steady without being stiff — a current that circulates through the group when the air needs moving and then stills naturally when the room has settled, so gradually that no one notices the transition from active presence to quiet contentment. There's a practical curiosity that engages with new ideas when they clear the air and a respect for tradition that comes from valuing what's weathered time. Systems exist but they flex. Commitments are honoured but the method stays responsive to what the situation actually needs. The imagination is grounded — appreciating beauty in the tangible rather than the theoretical, finding satisfaction in the well-tended space and the relationship that breathes easily rather than in abstraction.

Something built entirely to ease others eventually forgets it has a direction of its own. The altruism that puts everyone's comfort first, the cooperation that shapes every choice around what works for the room, the modesty that deflects every recognition — these create a beautiful atmosphere that The Breeze ends up maintaining rather than moving through. The care that shows up so reliably for others sets the standard for being a good friend, a good partner, a good presence impossibly high and aimed entirely outward. And the sympathy that reads everyone else's weather so well sometimes loses the ability to read its own — the stillness arrives without warning because it was never being monitored, and by the time it surfaces, the people depending on the gentle current have no framework for seeing The Breeze as something that might need moving rather than something that moves everything else.

The Breeze doesn't ask you to notice it. It just makes the room better — and you only feel the absence when it stops.
