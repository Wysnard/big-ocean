## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
- Source tree components to touch
- Testing standards summary

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)

### References

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Anti-Patterns

Do NOT introduce any of these patterns during implementation:

1. **Error handling scope** — No broad `catchAll`/`catchTag` that swallows errors. Only allowed: fail-open `catchTag("RedisOperationError", ...)` for resilience. Errors must propagate unchanged to the HTTP contract layer.
2. **Mock accuracy** — Mocks in `__mocks__/` must match live repository interfaces exactly. Never add methods to mocks that don't exist in the real implementation. Always use `vi.mock()` + original paths, never import from `__mocks__/` directly.
3. **Import discipline** — No cross-layer imports (infrastructure must not import from use-cases, domain must not import from infrastructure). No deep imports bypassing barrel exports. Use `@workspace/*` paths.
4. **Type safety** — No unsafe `as` casts (use type guards or `unknown` instead). No `in` operator for type narrowing (use discriminated unions with `_tag`). No `as any` without a justifying comment.
